<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
SAIL HO!
</h3>

<p>
They deplored the death of poor Mr. Quail; but
their blood was too much "up," to use a common
phrase, and their own peril was too imminent, to
permit them indulging in the same soft regrets and
mournful sentiments, that were aroused by the
sudden disappearance of Adrian Manfredi.
</p>

<p>
Notwithstanding the wild disorder that reigned
on board the unfortunate <i>Hermione</i>, the mutineers,
true to their original idea of keeping her, with the
vague intention of running her on their own account,
with Pedro Barradas as captain, and themselves as
crew and owners&mdash;a vague intention, indeed&mdash;steered
her towards Madagascar, under her fore and main
courses, jib, and spanker.  They rigged jury-top-masts,
and crossed jury-yards thereon; and, as the
breeze was fair for the Mozambique, they steered
in what they, rightly enough, conceived to be that
direction.
</p>

<p>
Sorely crippled though she was, and no longer
under a stately spread of snow-white canvas, as of
old, the fine ship flew on, and each night saw some
southern constellation sink into the horizon, to
appear no more.
</p>

<p>
Thus, in four days, and as many nights, she ran
nearly eight hundred miles, which brought her so
close to the mouth of the Mozambique Channel,
that she soon began to feel the steady breath of the
south-west monsoon, which begins there to blow in
April, and continues till November, so the ship ran
as fairly as even Pedro could have wished her.
</p>

<p>
During this time matters did not go quietly
between the adverse parties on board.
</p>

<p>
A secret sally, made by Morley Ashton, Dr. Heriot,
and Noah Gawthrop, up the companion-stair,
with the intention of capturing the scuttle-butt
in a very dark night, nearly ended in their
being discovered and cut off by Pedro's drowsy and
half-drunken watch; the butt&mdash;a cask with a square
hole cut in its bilge, and always kept on deck for
the use of the crew&mdash;containing about seven gallons
of water, was fortunately taken, the cabin regained
in safety, and the barricades replaced.
</p>

<p>
It was evident to our friends that a dread of their
well-supplied fire-arms, their truer aim and steady
determination, alone cooled the ardour of the crew,
and prevented them from making a vigorous
attempt, by a combined attack through the skylight
and companion-way, to storm the cabin and slay its
defenders.
</p>

<p>
Once or twice, however, a shot was fired, or a
missile flung, down the skylight, or a threat, or a
malediction, was levelled at the occupants of the
cabin.  Frequently shouts, cries, and quarrelling
were heard on deck, where evidently Pedro found
as much difficulty in enforcing obedience as his more
legal predecessor had done.
</p>

<p>
At the stern-windows Captain Phillips and his
friends kept, by turns, a constant look-out for a
passing sail, which they meant to signal by waving
a flag or table-cloth, or by firing their pistols; but
none was ever visible, nor was aught to be seen but
Mother Carey's chickens tripping along, for even
the albatrosses appeared seldom, so far was the ship
from the region of the Cape.
</p>

<p>
Under Captain Phillips and Tom Bartelot, those
in the cabin divided themselves into two watches,
which, to prevent surprise, were alternately vigilant
or sleeping by night.  This saved the personal
strength of the whole; but they soon grew pale
with anxiety and watching, and had a worn,
unshaven, and uncouth appearance.
</p>

<p>
The horror of their whole circumstances, and the
natural solicitude for the future, were somewhat
alleviated to Morley, who, in the dark watches of the
night, lay like a faithful mastiff at Ethel's
cabin-door, through which he, at times, conversed with
her in whispers, and had her dear hand passed to
him, that he might kiss and caress it; but all the
tales he had heard or read in his schoolboy-days, of
pirates, buccaneers, and other lawless folks upon the
high seas, crowded into memory now, and his soul
sickened within him, as he thought of how Ethel and
her sister would be situated, if the protection of
those who loved and guarded them failed.
</p>

<p>
On the second morning after the mutiny broke
out, and while those in the cabin were making
almost merry over the capture of the scuttle-butt,
with its welcome seven gallons of fresh water, their
attention was arrested by a commotion on deck, and
Zuares Barradas, who was at the wheel, shouted:
</p>

<p>
"Sail, ho!"
</p>

<p>
"Where?" asked his brother and several others.
</p>

<p>
"Estribord (starboard)," replied Zuares, as the
ship was running before the wind at the time.
</p>

<p>
"A sail! a sail! hope at last!" exclaimed the
prisoners in the cabin, while Tom Bartelot sprang
up the stern-lockers, and looked forth, but saw sea
and sky alone.  How to communicate with her,
without being immolated on the spot, was the first
and fullest idea of all.
</p>

<p>
They writhed in agony of spirit at the prospect of
succour&mdash;it might be vengeance&mdash;being, perhaps,
within hail, all to be attained, or all lost for ever.
</p>

<p>
At that moment, Badger, the long Yankee,
appeared at the open skylight, armed with a sharp
axe, which he shook significantly, and then shrank
back, lest a pistol-shot might respond to the
menace.
</p>

<p>
This man had long served on board an American
otter-hunter, and was hence, perhaps, the most
lawless character on board, as these craft are all
armed with cannon, have their hammocks in netting,
man-o'-war fashion, and, being illegal traders, fight
their way through the Pacific, and among the
Sandwich Islands, and, somewhat like the buccaneers of
old, are not wont to stand on trifles, so, in such
a service, Badger had long been inured to crime
and outrage.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a spare mizzen-topsail was drawn over
the skylight, nearly involving the cabin in darkness.
</p>

<p>
"What does this mean?" asked Mr. Basset;
"are they about to smother us?:
</p>

<p>
"It means that they are about to muffle us, for
the strange sail is close at hand," said Tom
Bartelot.
</p>

<p>
And almost immediately another sail was lowered,
as if to dry, over the taffrail, covering the four stern
windows like a thick curtain, and thus rendering the
cabin quite dark, and all communication with the
stranger impossible.
</p>

<p>
"This is a most extraordinary proceeding," said
Mr. Basset.
</p>

<p>
"Not at all, sir," said Captain Phillips.  "These
are knowing rascals, who have us at their mercy;
and have resolved that, if possible, we shall neither
make signals to the stranger or overhear what
passes."
</p>

<p>
"Hark&mdash;what sound is that?" asked Morley.
</p>

<p>
"Steam blowing off," replied Tom Bartelot,
listening intently.
</p>

<p>
"Steam!" exclaimed Morley.
</p>

<p>
"Then, by heaven, it is a man-o'-war," said
Phillips.
</p>

<p>
"A man-o'-war&mdash;a man-o'-war," chorussed all in
great excitement.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Heaven! to be on the verge of safety, and
yet to be immured here with my two girls!"
exclaimed Mr. Basset, with great bitterness.  "I shall
force my way on deck.  I am commissioned by the
Crown&mdash;a judge&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"To be cut down, destroyed&mdash;Badger is armed
with an axe, and the first head that appears will be
cloven to the teeth.  Oh, my dear sir," said Morley,
grasping his sleeve, "be wary&mdash;be persuaded."
</p>

<p>
"D&mdash;n my eyes! think o' bein' bottled down
here, and a royal pennant within hail!  It's enough
to make one's biler bust!" growled Noah, hitching
up his trousers.
</p>

<p>
"Hark; they are hailing&mdash;now the pirates are
lying to," said Captain Phillips, as they heard
the now ungreased sling of the mainyard grating
under the top, when it was swung round, and the
ship lay to.
</p>

<p>
"Ship ahoy!" cried a clear and somewhat
authoritative voice, that came distinctly over the water
about a hundred yards distant.
</p>

<p>
"Hollo!" responded Pedro, through Captain
Phillips's speaking trumpet, as he sprang on one of
the starboard carronade slides, while the ship
plunged, as she rose and fell impatiently on the
long rollers and heavy swell made by what was
evidently the screw propeller of a large steamer.
</p>

<p>
"What ship is that?" demanded the same voice.
</p>

<p>
"The <i>General Jackson</i>, of Boston, United States,"
replied Pedro without hesitation.
</p>

<p>
"They did well to muffle up her stern&mdash;<i>Hermione</i>,
of London, is painted there plain enough," said
Captain Phillips.
</p>

<p>
"Where from, and whither bound?"
</p>

<p>
"From Boston to Bombay direct," replied Pedro.
</p>

<p>
"Why didn't you show your colours?" was
the next rather suspicious question of the British
officer.
</p>

<p>
"Our signal-chest was washed overboard.  How
does the Mozambique bear?"
</p>

<p>
"Cape St. Mary bears about two hundred miles,
nor'-nor'-east."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you.  What ship are you?"
</p>

<p>
All listened breathlessly.
</p>

<p>
"Her Britannic Majesty's steam-corvette the
<i>Clyde</i>, Captain Sir Horace Seymour.  How did you
lose your masts?"
</p>

<p>
"A typhoon carried them away."
</p>

<p>
"A typhoon in these seas!" exclaimed the other,
through his trumpet.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"We felt nothing of it.  Do you want any assistance?
We can send a boat's crew, or a gang of
carpenters, on board."
</p>

<p>
"No, no," replied Pedro, hastily, as hope rose in
the panting hearts of those below, and curses to
the lips of those above; "we have lots of spare
spars."
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean to pass through the Mozambique Channel?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Are you armed?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"How?"
</p>

<p>
"With four six-pound carronades and some
small arms."
</p>

<p>
"That is lucky; keep a bright look-out after you
pass the Europa rocks."
</p>

<p>
"For what reason?"
</p>

<p>
"Some Malay pirates, in three large red proas,
or country boats, have destroyed more than one ship
in that quarter, so be prepared."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, we shall&mdash;good-bye."
</p>

<p>
"Good-bye; pleasant voyage."
</p>

<p>
Each vessel filled away, and the rush of the warship's
screw propeller was heard by those imprisoned
in the cabin as they separated, and as it died away
in the distance, so did hope die, and silent despair
gather in the hearts of our friends below.
</p>

<p>
Repentant, and almost full of horror for the part
he was now acting, as the ship of war braced up her
yards, and her screw began to revolve, Cramply
Hawkshaw rushed to the starboard gangway, and was
about to hail her again.  What he was about to say
he scarcely knew, but in a moment the powerful
hand of Pedro Barradas was on his throat.  By
main strength the latter hurled him at full length
upon the deck, and with one knee planted on his
chest, and a knife upheld above him:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Silenzio, perro!</i> (Silence, dog!)" he hissed,
through his sharp white teeth; "one word, one
whisper, and it is your last!"
</p>

<p>
Pedro's tawny visage was pale, almost pea-green
with rage, and with black eyes, that gleamed like
two sombre carbuncles, he glared into the very soul
of the miserable Hawkshaw, and continued to hold
him thus for some time.  He then dragged him up,
and roughly shook him off, saying, as he did so,
with a ferocious grimace, and sheathing his knife:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Por ma vida</i>!  I don't know why I don't kill
you now, as I mean to do so, at some time or
other."
</p>

<p>
"So we are only 200 miles from El Cabo de Santa
Maria?" said Zuares, who was still at the wheel.
</p>

<p>
"Nor'-nor'-east," added Pedro, giving a glance
at the compasses in the binnacle; "two points
more, Zuares."
</p>

<p>
"The monsoon will soon bring us abreast of it, I
calc'late," drawled Badger, who now enjoyed the
honourable post of second in command.  "Thunder! then
we shall all be liberty boys, and look out our
go-ashore togs.  I reckons on bein' all the go
among the Malay gals, eh, Zuares!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Vivan los marineros!</i>" cried the young Mexican.
</p>

<p>
"And down with the 'tarnal imps below!" added
Badger, striking his huge splay foot on the deck, as
he relieved the wheel, notwithstanding his brevet
rank.
</p>

<p>
The headland named by the officer of the corvette
is the most southern point of the long narrow island
of Madagascar; but no sooner had all sounds
indicative of her presence died away, than Captain
Phillips and his companions, who had listened to
the colloquy above, as if spell-bound, broke into
expressions of bitter regret that they had not all
made a scramble on deck, and risked death or
anything, that some, at least, might have been
saved! but these ideas came too late, and they
could only hope for a better chance next time; so
true it is, as some one says, that regrets for the
past, and dreams for the future, make up the whole
career of human life, at sea as well as on shore.

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br /><br />
THE FORTITUDE OF ETHEL.
</h3>

<p>
On the evening succeeding this day, Morley and
Mr. Basset spent some hours with Ethel and Rose
in the little cabin, while their friends kept their
anxious watch in the outer one, over the skylight of
which the sail was yet drawn.  That which had been
hung over the taffrail was hauled in; but the use it
had been put to prevented Captain Phillips, on this
occasion, from chalking on a black board the
demand for succour which he meant to exhibit from
the cabin windows, if a feasible opportunity with a
passing sail occurred.
</p>

<p>
There was but little conversation with the Bassets,
so the time passed in sad glances and sadder sighs;
but Ethel seemed to have more confidence, more
fortitude, and more hope for the future than any of
those about her.
</p>

<p>
Old Nance Folgate lay on her bed, where, from
time to time, she sighed over the peaceful security
of her cottage in a green lane at Acton-Rennel, and
groaned heavily at the reflection that she would
never see it any more, or, perhaps, the solid earth
again.
</p>

<p>
Rose sat on a hassock on the cabin-floor, with
her pretty head resting, child-like, on her father's
knee, while his hands were crossed caressingly
above it.
</p>

<p>
Ethel half drooped her head on Morley's shoulder,
and so they sat, buried in thought and anxiety, each
for the others rather than themselves, for "the
passion of love and parental affection are
counterparts of each other," says Reid; "and, meeting
with a proper return, are the sources of all domestic
felicity, the greatest, next to that of a good
conscience, which this world affords.  But its joys and
griefs are fitter to be sung than said."
</p>

<p>
As Mr. Basset gazed upon his two daughters, and
summed up the dangers which menaced them, how
bitterly he repented that he had not remained in
England, even with the wreck of his fortune, and
sought subsistence there in any way, rather than
have stooped to the false pride which made him
seek that colonial appointment, and lured him away
from home.
</p>

<p>
These, and many such ideas, occurred to him
when it was too late to retreat, or reverse the
dictates of fate.
</p>

<p>
Morley's heart swelled with mingled love and
sorrow, as he looked on Ethel's pale and delicate
face.  Could it be that they were only united, to be,
perhaps, more surely parted again?  Surely no pair
of lovers, even in the most highly-spiced "sensational
novel," were ever the victims of adverse fate
so much as they.
</p>

<p>
They were silent; but their hearts understood
each other, for their eyes were the interpreters of a
silent language, known to lovers only.  Still, as
we have said, amid the horrors of anticipation,
Ethel singularly preserved her presence of mind,
and seemed to rise superior to the present occasion.
With one hand clasped in Morley's, she sat with her
Bible open on her knee, and, before they separated
for the night, she read aloud the twenty-first chapter
of Revelation, for religion and regard could soothe
or sweeten even their adverse destiny.
</p>

<p>
On the fly-leaf of this Bible was written the
autograph of her mother, "Ethel Rose Basset, London,"
dated on her bridal-day, just twenty-four years
before, so it was one of Ethels most valued relics;
and while she read, her pallor and beauty, her pure
profile and sublime composure, together with the
richness and softness of her sweet English voice,
were very touching; and she had listeners without
who bent their heads to hear her, for at the
cabin-door were Bartelot, Morrison, and Heriot, who sat
on guard, with old Noah, who, more reverent than
they, doffed his battered tarpaulin in a dark corner,
and, as the words fell from Ethel's lips, he hoped
they might prove prophetic, for sailors generally
are deeply impressed by anything appertaining to
religion, though having strong doubts about the
policy of voyaging with a black cat or a parson.
</p>

<p>
So Ethel read on, and Noah's grizzled head bent
lower, as she read:
</p>

<p>
"And God shall wipe away all tears from their
eyes, and there shall be no more death, neither
sorrow, nor crying; neither shall there be any
more pain, for the former things are passed
away.
</p>

<p>
"He that overcometh shall inherit all things, for
I will be his God, and he shall be my son.
</p>

<p>
"<i>But</i> the fearful, and unbelieving, the abominable,
and murderers, &amp;c., shall have their part in
the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone,
which is the second death."
</p>

<p>
At such a time, in such a place, and with a dark
doom perhaps hanging over all, Ethel's sweet low
voice thrilled through every heart; so she continued
to inspire them with confidence, and there was
almost a smile upon her father's careworn and
anxious face as he kissed her and Rose, and retiring
with Morley, closed the cabin-door, and left them
to repose.
</p>

<p>
"Good night, Morley&mdash;good night, dear papa,"
was again whispered through the cabin-door.
</p>

<p>
"Good night!  God bless you both, darlings,"
said Mr. Basset.
</p>

<p>
"Sleep if you can, dear girls," added Morley, as
he and Mr. Basset picked their way through the
cabin by the light of a candle (which feebly replaced
the lamp that whilom swung from the beams), and
joined the party who were on watch under Captain
Phillips, while Tom Bartelot, with his three&mdash;for
there were only eight men in all in the cabin now,
opposed to twenty, including Hawkshaw&mdash;prepared
to sleep while they could.
</p>

<p>
They heard the starboard tacks eased off, as the
wind&mdash;the south-west monsoon&mdash;came more duly
aft; and steering by the stars, Pedro, a skilful
mariner, kept the ship he had captured in the
course he wished her to pursue.
</p>

<p>
So, as the night stole on, a strange quiet reigned
on deck&mdash;a silence which seemed almost ominous,
when the characters and purpose of those who held
the ship were considered; and they were more
numerous now, since the death of the first mate and
the steward.
</p>

<p>
But the actual reason of the extreme quietness
was, that some of the crew were weary with working
at the jury rigging; others had dozed themselves off
to sleep, quite intoxicated, with some cases of Cliquot
which they had started out of the forehold; there
was scarcely any watch on deck save the man at the
wheel, who permitted the ship to yaw fearfully,
and to fall away from her course every moment;
while the two Barradas, with Badger and Sharkey,
were in the forecastle, devising means to get
possession of the cabin by stratagem, and to massacre
its male occupants, against whom, for their skilful
resistance, these pirates cherished a glow of real
vengeance, as if a wrong had been done them; and
if those in the cabin had but known the state of
matters on deck, they might have recaptured the
ship with ease, and closed the fore-scuttle like a
trap on the ruffians below.
</p>

<p>
Captain Phillips was certain that they could
scarcely pass through the Mozambique Channel, the
narrowest part of which is about two hundred and
forty miles wide, and studded with many islands,
without being overhauled by some homeward-bound
ship; and though one great chance of succour had
gone for nothing, so assured did he feel of ultimately
getting the mutineers punished, that he kept about
his own person the muster-roll&mdash;a document which
every shipmaster must keep, for therein are specified
his own name, with the names of all his ship's
company, their birth-places, with their time and
place of entering before the mast, and so forth,
together with their register-tickets&mdash;all of which he
duly hoped to lay at a future day before a
commissioned officer in Her Majesty's service, or some
civil magistrate, prior to seeing the Barradas and
their companions swinging at the yard-arm; but,
unhappily for worthy Captain Phillips and his
friends, all these hopes of retribution seemed very
dim and distant yet.
</p>

<p>
Slowly the night stole on.
</p>

<p>
Morley felt, he knew not why, painfully wakeful;
and, unlike his companions in the captain's watch,
he had no necessity to pinch his arms, rub his eyes,
or so forth, to keep as much awake as possible.
</p>

<p>
The cabin looked dreary and desolate by the
feeble light of the candle, which sputtered in the
wind that came between the skylight and the sail
which still covered it.  The broken furniture, the
splintered panelling, the general air of wreck and
ruin that pervaded it, the deep shadows against
which the pale and haggard faces of his companions,
who slept with weapon in hand, were sharply defined,
seemed like a vision or dream altogether, and
such he might almost have deemed it, but for the
steady rolling of the ship, which was now running
before the wind; the noise of the water under the
counter; the clatter of the empty champagne bottles
which strewed the deck, and with every roll of the
ship flew, clashing and breaking, from port to
starboard; the clank of the rudder in its iron bands,
the whistling hum of the night-wind, that sung
monotonously through the rigging aloft!
</p>

<p>
He frequently turned his eyes to the dim streak
of light that shone from under the door of the little
cabin occupied by the sisters, and hoped that now,
in the oblivion of sleep, they had found repose for a
time; and in imagination he saw their sweet faces
hushed upon the same pillow, with Rose's nestling
in Ethel's gentle bosom.
</p>

<p>
Twice that streak of light seemed to die away in
obscurity, and twice the shadow of a foot seemed to
darken it.
</p>

<p>
Were Rose or Ethel stirring?
</p>

<p>
He listened, but all remained still there, till
suddenly a gasping sob, a wild, half-stifled cry, and
then the sound as of something or some one falling
heavily on the cabin floor, made him leap up as with
a shock of electricity, and spring towards their
door.
</p>

<p>
Either it was fastened within, or his trembling
fingers failed in strength when most he needed it.
</p>

<p>
Fully a minute elapsed ere he and Tom Bartelot
forced open the door, and they all crowded in, to
find the little cabin quite dark.
</p>

<p>
"A light&mdash;a light! for Heaven's sake!" cried
Morley.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, what new horror, what new calamity is this?"
added Mr. Basset, wringing his hands, as Captain
Phillips brought the candle from the tin sconce in
the outer cabin.
</p>

<p>
Half disrobed for the night, as they were never
completely undressed now, Rose Basset lay on the
floor on her face in a swoon.  Nance Folgate, beside
herself with terror, was coiled up among the blankets
of her berth, speechless or incoherent&mdash;otherwise
the little cabin was empty, for <i>Ethel was no longer
there</i>!
</p>

<p>
The Bible from which she had been reading overnight
lay upon the floor, crushed and bruised, as if
by a heavy foot.  Close by it was a black and
gold-coloured Indian shawl, which she had worn over her
shoulders; but no other trace remained in that
little cabin of Ethel Basset, who seemed to have
been strangely and mysteriously spirited out of it.
</p>

<p>
Morley felt stunned, and felt also how immeasurably
all imagination and anticipation were unequal
to portray the horror of such a shock as this!

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br /><br />
THE DOOR IN THE BULKHEAD.
</h3>

<p>
We left the leaders of the mutiny in the forecastle,
consulting, in their own coarse and blustering
fashion, about the capture of the cabin, and thus
acquiring entire possession of the ship.
</p>

<p>
"Batten down the companion-hatch&mdash;kiver up
the skylight with tarpaulin," suggested the short,
thickset ruffian Sharkey, "and then smoke 'em
out, like rats."
</p>

<p>
"Wa-al, but look ye here&mdash;the tew gals,"
drawled Badger, inserting an enormous quid in his
mouth with the point of his jack-knife.  "Would ye
smoke 'em tew, till they went dead, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Aye, the senoritas," added Zuares, "that
would never do; they are the best plunder on
board&mdash;the plunder most to my taste, at least."
</p>

<p>
"The cabin we must and shall get," said Pedro,
grinding his teeth.  "While one of these men aft is
permitted to live, the ship cannot be said to be
ours."
</p>

<p>
"And if one should escape, anyhow," added
Sharkey, "we might have some man-o'-war in our
wake before we knew where we were."
</p>

<p>
"Dead men tell no tales, darn 'em, that's old
buccaneer style, long afore Kidd went a-cruising
in the <i>Vulture</i>," said the Yankee; "and they or we
must be gone coons, or, airthquakes and ginger! you
can't reckon on what may 'appen, you can't."
</p>

<p>
"And they have possession of the bread, beef,
and spirit room, and all that we most require,"
resumed Pedro, "for we can't eat the dry goods and
hardware in the forehold, mates; so the knife it
must be."
</p>

<p>
As the pirate spoke, a fierce gleam came into his
eyes, and in his blind wrath he drove his knife
repeatedly into the lid of the sea-chest, around
which they were seated, and which proved to be
the property of his American compatriot, Mr. Badger.
</p>

<p>
"Walley of Gehosophat! airthquakes and
alligators!" exclaimed that personage; "keep calm
dew, Pedro.  Yew are getting tew riled, capting.
I'd like to gouge old Phillips, rayther, and prison
the whole bilin' of 'em aft!"
</p>

<p>
"Massa Pedro, Massa Barradas," said Quaco, the
black cook, looking suddenly out of his berth with a
tremendous grin on his sable visage, "I could tell
you something funny&mdash;yaas! yaas!&mdash;I could."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Maldita!</i> then why the devil don't you tell
it," growled Pedro; "time is short, and I can't
get the Malay proas out of my head."
</p>

<p>
"You know where the wite gals sleep?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; out with what you have got to say, you
dark-skinned fool."
</p>

<p>
"Yaas! yaas!" grinned Quaco, whose yellow
eyeballs gleamed with mischief.
</p>

<p>
"Presto, quick, or my knife may tickle your
ribs," roared Pedro, setting down a bottle, from
which he had sucked the last drop of a mixture of
champagne and brandy, compounded by Badger.
</p>

<p>
"Under the companion-stair, Massa Pedro, a
door opens with a slide into the wite gals' cabin."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Demonio!</i> do you say so, darkey?"
</p>

<p>
"Can yew make tracks ahead now, capting?"
</p>

<p>
"You are certain of this, Quaco?" said Pedro,
bending his black brows as he looked at the cook.
</p>

<p>
"Sartain as that um a living nigger, Massa
Pedro, yaas! yaas!  Boy Joe, the steward, showed
it to Quaco many a time."
</p>

<p>
"And what use would you make of this door, Quaco?"
</p>

<p>
"What use?" repeated the negro, putting out a
long, red tongue, while a leer, like that of a fiend,
shone in his black, glittering, and half-shut eyes.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Hombre!</i> yes, speak."
</p>

<p>
"Get at the wite gals fust, and the cabin
arter&mdash;yaas! yaas!&mdash;eh, Massa Pedro?"
</p>

<p>
"I reckons, Pedro, that the darkey is the only
one among us with any brains in his skull, a thick
'un though it be," said Badger; "but this sliding
door&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I will look to it now," said Pedro, staggering
up, for he was very tipsy.  "<i>Cuidado</i>, mates&mdash;take
care who follows me till I call for help," he added,
with a dark glance at Hawkshaw, who eyed him
with sullen resentment from a corner of the
comfortless den, of which he was now one of the
occupants.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Barradas," he exclaimed, "if you have a
human soul, spare them.  They will surely die."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, <i>demonio</i>, yes&mdash;yes.  These fine ladies have
a habit of dying, and always coming to again," said
Zuares, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Make way there," exclaimed Pedro, brandishing
his knife with something of mock and more of real
ferocity.  "One of them is mine by a cast of the
dice, and mine she shall be," he added, hoarsely and
huskily, while reeling towards the ladder.
</p>

<p>
"It is for my sins I am here," groaned Hawkshaw.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it is not likely for your virtues that you
are among us, mate," said Zuares, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Cuidar el lobo</i> (Beware of the wolf)!" said
Pedro, with a cruel grin, as he went up through the
scuttle, or little hatch of the forecastle, and went
aft with a stealthy step.
</p>

<p>
Inflamed to a dangerous pitch of rashness, lust,
and savagery by the champagne and brandy, which
he had been mixing and imbibing freely, this
powerful and agile ruffian left the bunks on his fatal
errand.
</p>

<p>
Save Bolter, the Canadian, who was at the wheel,
and half tipsy too, there was not a man on deck now.
Under her courses the ship was going before the
wind, with a gentle breeze, which fanned pleasantly
the hot, flushed face of Pedro Barradas, who paused
for a moment, looked aloft, and then at the horizon.
</p>

<p>
The moon had newly risen from the sea to the
eastward.  To the west a line of deep crimson light,
but transparent as the purest crystal, lingered
between the dark horizon of the ocean and a long
straight bank of black cloud, and the wave-tops, of
a deeper tint than indigo, were seen to rise and fall
incessantly between.  Amid this low and blood-red
belt of light, a few bright stars were twinkling.
</p>

<p>
Though weird and impressive, the night was
solemn and pleasing; but all its gentle influences
were lost on the ruffianly soul of Pedro Barradas.
</p>

<p>
Being barefooted, he crept along unheard, and at
the companion-way he paused to listen.
</p>

<p>
No sound came from the cabin; but he knew
well that there were armed watchers below&mdash;armed
better than himself&mdash;so he looked carefully to the
powder in the pan of his old flint-lock and
brass-barrelled Spanish pistol, felt if his knife was loose
in its sheath, and then crept softly down the
companion-stair, and past the cabin-door, on the inside
of which Morley Ashton was seated on Mr. Basset's
trunk of law-books, as already described, listening
to the casual sounds, amongst which he heard
neither the large bare feet of Pedro nor the creaking
of the stairs, as the barricade and the straining
of the ship's timbers muffled everything in the
steerage.
</p>

<p>
Stooping down on his hands and knees, with his
black eyes close to the bulkhead, or partition, Pedro
felt about for the door mentioned by the
mischievous Quaco, and discovered it at once.
</p>

<p>
It was an aperture formed in the bulkhead, about
four feet high and nearly three feet broad; it slid
in grooves, like a window-sash, and could be pulled
up by two brass knobs, screwed into the middle of
the door for that purpose.  It had evidently been
made for the conveyance of stores, casks, bales, &amp;c.,
in and out, when that cabin was not required by
passengers; and the strong hands of the swarthy
Pedro almost trembled with ferocious joy and
eagerness as he grasped the knobs, and essayed to remove
the only barrier that lay between him and his
helpless victims.
</p>

<p>
Stiffened by long disuse, it refused for a time to
yield.  At the third effort he started it, and a ray
of light shone out below its lower edge.  Stealthily
as a tiger cat, Pedro paused to listen.  All was still
within, and the perfect silence there assured him
that the two young ladies and their old attendant
slept.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Bueno!</i>" he muttered, with a chuckle of satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
Then he inserted his hard, copper-coloured hands,
and slowly and gently drew the door up within its
slide, its creaking being lost amid the other sounds
incident to the motion of the ship.
</p>

<p>
Stooping, he entered, and found himself almost
within arm's length of the bed wherein the sisters
lay, and he held his obnoxious breath as he drew
nearer.
</p>

<p>
Accustomed to take every precaution, and fertile
in expedients, he glanced now at the cabin-door, and
saw a brass bolt on the inside.  This he softly shot
into its place, to prevent surprise or interruption
by the occupants of the larger cabin.
</p>

<p>
Now a sound made his heart start, his eyes gleam,
and his hand clutch the knife in his girdle; but it
was only a prolonged snore from the old attendant,
Nance Folgate.
</p>

<p>
While his dark eyes flashed with impatience, the
swarthy Spanish American drew near, and looked
boldly and steadily upon the sleeping girls.  Both
seemed so delicately pale, so beautiful and gentle,
when hushed together in repose, that for a moment,
as the gust of evil passion mounted to his head, he
knew not upon which to pounce.
</p>

<p>
Both sisters were only partially undressed, but
the closeness of the little cabin had made them
partly throw off the coverlet.
</p>

<p>
Rose lay with her soft cheek reposing on Ethel's
bare white shoulder, and their rounded arms, so
taper and delicately fair, were clasped about each
other.  Shining like flossy silk, a dark tress of
Ethel's hair mingled with her sister's lighter braids.
</p>

<p>
A smile that was singularly sweet played about
the childlike mouth of Rose; but Ethel's face was
pale and placid, and the length of the dark lashes
that fringed her snow-white eyelids imparted a
charming softness to her face, while a half sigh
that escaped her from time to time made her
swelling bosom heave beneath her sister's cheek.
</p>

<p>
Never had their atrocious visitor looked on two
such fair, soft, English faces, nestling thus a-bed;
and there was such an air of enchanting innocence,
candour, and perfect modesty about the two sleeping
sisters, that, instead of calming the daring
thoughts which swelled in the heart of Barradas, it
served only to add fresh stings to them.
</p>

<p>
We have said that, for a moment, he was doubtful
which to seize.  Rose was certainly the smallest
and most easily borne; but Ethel's larger form
tempted him the most.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Que bonita!</i> it shall be you," he muttered.
</p>

<p>
Drawing from his muscular bull-like throat a
dirty, greasy necktie, he suddenly twisted it tightly
over Ethel's face, and particularly across her mouth,
so that to make an outcry was impossible on her
part.
</p>

<p>
He then drew her out of bed, and, in so doing,
awoke Rose, whose shrill shriek at once reached the
ears of Morley Ashton.
</p>

<p>
"<i>A los infernos!</i>" cried Pedro, savagely.
</p>

<p>
His knife was his first idea; but, as the girl's life
was not worth taking, he dashed out the cabin-lamp
with his clenched hand, tore Ethel with brutal
violence through the aperture by which he had entered,
and shut the sliding door with a crash, preventing,
but unintentionally, the entrance of his amiable
brother Zuares, who had glided after him like a
tawny snake, less with views of fraternal assistance
than with those of doing a little abduction on his
own account.
</p>

<p>
Rose fell senseless on her face; but Ethel,
recovering something of her native energy and
strength, grasped the rail of the companion-stair
with such vigour that all the muscle of Barradas
was required to tear her tender hands away from it,
and then, with, an awful imprecation of mingled
rage and triumph, he sprang up and bore her along
the deck.
</p>

<p>
On lifting up Ethel's Indian shawl, part of it was
found wedged in the port, or door in the bulkhead,
thus showing at once the place and mode of ingress.
</p>

<p>
But so firmly had Barradas's strong hand shut it
down that it was not until after several efforts made
by Phillips and Bartelot, the avenue was opened.
Then Morley pressed through, and pistol in hand,
rushed like a madman on deck, just in time to see
Ethel&mdash;his tender and beloved Ethel&mdash;borne by
Pedro down the fore-scuttle, into the very den
and stronghold of the mutineers!
</p>

<p>
As he sprang forward, an empty cask&mdash;part of
the plunder&mdash;started from the hold, rolled against
him; he slipped, and fell heavily on the deck.
Then, on rising, half stunned, he heard the sound
of pistol-shots in the forecastle, followed by a
despairing cry from Ethel, and a man's hoarse howl
of agony.
</p>

<p>
At that awful moment the heart of Morley died
within him, and his blood seemed turned to water.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br /><br />
ETHEL AMONG THE MUTINEERS.
</h3>

<p>
In a preceding chapter we have described the
forecastle bunks of the <i>Hermione</i>, when the ship was in
a state of good order and discipline, and when that
portion of her hull was daily drenched with water,
when the head-pump was rigged by the morning
watch, and the swab and holystone were in daily use.
</p>

<p>
Now that dreary little den was as filthy as its
dirty occupants could make it, and was strewn with
half-picked bones of beef and bacon, with broken
or empty bottles, and in almost every berth there
lay, with his clothes on, a half-drunk seaman.
</p>

<p>
The atmosphere, redolent of tar, paint, and bilge,
was stifling; moreover, it was thick with the smoke
of coarse pig-tail tobacco, that obscured the rays of
the feeble lamp, and rendered the place more
noxious and horrible.
</p>

<p>
It was damp and chill, too, for there was an
unheeded leak about the heel of the bowsprit, and
near the windlass-bitts, which came through the
deck into the forecastle, and it made the place more
comfortless still.
</p>

<p>
The <i>tout ensemble</i> of it, the grimy faces which
looked forth upon her from the dark recesses of the
bunks, the great chin and cheek-bones of Badger,
the hideous Sharkey, the black visage of Quaco and
others, the ferocious character of the man in whose
grasp she found herself, helpless, abandoned, or
only to be rescued after a scene, perhaps, of
butchery and slaughter&mdash;the slaughter of her
dearest friends&mdash;appalled, beyond all description,
the soul of gentle Ethel Basset.
</p>

<p>
In her extreme perturbation and agony of spirit,
she could not even pray; "but God often hears the
heart that is silent better than the lips that speak."
</p>

<p>
"Jee-rusalem and apple-sarce!" exclaimed the
Yankee, Badger, leaping out of his berth, and
standing at about half his full height, with his long
fingers planted on his knees, for the space between
beams was very scanty, "here comes Capting
Pedro, with the black-eyed gal&mdash;the sarcy stunner
he's been nuts on so long!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Para!</i> hold! keep back!" said Pedro, panting,
and almost breathless, as he pushed aside
Badger, whose insolent face was peering within an
inch of Ethel.
</p>

<p>
"Jee-rusalem! kinder rum lover you'll make
her, I calkilate."
</p>

<p>
"He'll make her a rough one, at any rate,"
added Sharkey, while a roar of coarse laughter
greeted the appearance of the miserable girl, whom
Pedro seated with rough kindness on a sea-chest,
saying&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mi queridita&mdash;estrella mia,</i>* at Orizaba and
San Francisco I was the terror of the old women and
the idol of the young ones.  So come, let us be
friends and shipmates."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
* My little dear&mdash;my star.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
He attempted to force a kiss; but Ethel uttered
a low wail, and an expression of such loathing and
terror filled her face, that even he paused, and she
pressed her hands upon her breast, as if her
emotion would burst it.
</p>

<p>
Perceiving this action, Pedro roughly thrust his
daring hand into her bosom, and tore out a packet
which had lately been carried there for concealment.
While holding her with one hand, he held
up the packet with the other, and tore it open with
his teeth.
</p>

<p>
Then he cast it from him with a malediction, on
finding that it contained but a few withered
leaves&mdash;the daisies she had gathered on her mother's
grave.
</p>

<p>
Oh, that she were beside it now in peaceful Acton-Rennel!
</p>

<p>
"Try some o' this, my gal," said Badger,
presenting a little gallipot full of rum-and-water; "it's
right Jamaiky; I takes to it unkimmin, marm, like
a babby to its mother's milk.  Do have a
drop&mdash;'alf a totful, my gal."
</p>

<p>
Ethel shrunk back in silent misery, and Pedro
kept his left hand resolutely round her waist, while
holding her right hand in his.
</p>

<p>
"Don't yew be so darned proud, my sarcy
Britisher," resumed the bantering ruffian, with an
offended air.  "We'll take the pride out o' yew
afore we're done with yew.  I'm a true-blooded
Yankee, marm, though tall enough for a
Paddygonian.  The Paddygonians come from South
'Merriker, Pedro's country, while I was raised
about Cape Cod.  'Guess yew never heerd o' sich
a cape in the stupid old country, though yew ought
to rayther, for we licked the Britishers there, as we
dew everywhere else on airth, and why shouldn't
we, when their hearts are like wooden nutmegs?"
</p>

<p>
Ethel looked round despairingly, but saw no aid,
nor hope, nor mercy.
</p>

<p>
Bad, wild, and cruel though he was, there came
something of pity into the eye and heart of Zuares
Barradas, when he saw this lovely girl, one so fair,
and so delicately nurtured, in this frightful
situation&mdash;her dress torn and disordered, and blood
trickling from her nostrils&mdash;in such a place, and in
such hands, for he knew what was about to ensue,
and he knew his elder brother to be an incarnate
fiend.
</p>

<p>
There was another, half-concealed amid the
smoke of this murky den, who regarded her with
more than pity, and this was Cramply Hawkshaw;
but he felt that to protect her was to die, and to die
he had not yet the courage.
</p>

<p>
At last her eyes met his.
</p>

<p>
"Forgive me, Ethel Basset," he said, mournfully;
"oh, forgive me the past!"
</p>

<p>
"I do forgive you," she replied, in a trembling
voice, "and trust a time may come when you will
be able to forgive yourself."
</p>

<p>
Her soft, sweet voice seemed to thrill through the
marrow of his bones.
</p>

<p>
Bad and reckless, desperate and wicked though
he was, the memory of pleasant and of peaceful
days&mdash;days of good-will and happiness, when he had
tried to forget his past wild life in South America&mdash;days
spent at Laurel Lodge amid all the elegances
of civilised life, came thronging now on Hawkshaw's
mind.  So the inscrutable soul of this miserable
man seemed to die away within him, when he beheld,
now in a felon's daring grasp, one who had been his
hostess, his friend, and the object of his own most
selfish passions!
</p>

<p>
Though she felt as if dying of shame and terror,
fearfully pale, and calm, and holy Ethel looked, for
she thanked God in her innocent heart that she had
been taken&mdash;even from Morley&mdash;and Rose left to
comfort, perhaps, their beloved father, and as she
folded her white and tremulous hands upon her
swelling bosom, she felt that the dread hour had
come when she must surely die.
</p>

<p>
Oh, who could once have foretold the awful scene
of outrage through which, perhaps, her blameless
life was to pass away.
</p>

<p>
And now, as Pedro's iron grasp about her
tightened, and the laughter rung around her, like
a chorus of devils, she lifted her imploring eyes
to Hawkshaw, and their gaze seemed to turn him
into stone.
</p>

<p>
Sorrow, horror, and upbraiding&mdash;all were there
expressed.
</p>

<p>
It was she, the same Ethel, that he&mdash;blood-guilty
though he was, and selfish too&mdash;had ventured
to love in peaceful England.  She, who had never
coquettishly allured nor proudly repulsed him; but
had been gentle and polite, according to the rules of
well-bred society&mdash;gentle, even, and pitiful&mdash;until
she knew his crimes and his character, and learned
to abhor them.
</p>

<p>
All this rushed like a flood upon his memory, and
Cramply Hawkshaw, with all his errors, faults, and
crimes, felt, for the moment, the soul of a hero
within him, and he resolved to save Ethel Basset
from disgrace, or die in the effort&mdash;yea, to save her
even for Morley Ashton.
</p>

<p>
"Ethel," said he, in a breathless voice, "love me
as a friend, and I will protect&mdash;it may be, save you!"
</p>

<p>
"Love&mdash;friendship&mdash;Oh Hawkshaw, save me if
you can, but talk not of love and friendship, after
the awful past, and in presence of companions such
as these," replied Ethel, shuddering.
</p>

<p>
"Alas!  I feel that guilt gives a shame and horror,
Ethel, which fail even to cure it."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Morte de Dios!</i>" growled Pedro, grinding his
teeth, and turning round with flashing eyes; "what
is this I hear?"
</p>

<p>
"Your death-shot, wretch!&mdash;take that, and die!"
cried Hawkshaw, as he fired his pistol full at the
dark head of Pedro Barradas, who received the shot
in his elbow, just as he raised the arm to protect
his face.
</p>

<p>
"Malediction!" he exclaimed, with a howl of
agony, as he dropped the limb, which was fearfully
shattered.  Then Hawkshaw&mdash;endued with twice
his natural strength&mdash;for, when roused by passion,
or nerved by danger, he wras no ordinary
man&mdash;snatched Ethel amid the smoke, glided with her up
the steps and through the forescuttle, and placed
her in the arms of Dr. Heriot, who, with all her
friends came rushing forward, for this episode did
not occupy five minutes.
</p>

<p>
As Ethel was borne aft, a dozen of hands and
arms came up through the forescuttle, and
Hawkshaw was torn down within it.
</p>

<p>
"Gag him&mdash;lynch him&mdash;stick the 'tarnal varmint!"
cried Badger, and the death shrieks of the
miserable Hawkshaw were drowned amid the storm
of maledictions which accompanied the shots and
blows dealt him by the knives of Zuares, Badger,
Quaco, and others; and again and again they
continued to bury them in his body, long after he
was dead.
</p>

<p>
It was Pedro's howl of agony, and the two first
pistol-shots, that were heard by Morley as he
staggered up, half-stunned, from the deck, and felt
himself seized by Tom Bartelot.
</p>

<p>
All hurried below with Ethel.  The cabin was
regained, the barricades were again made fast, and
our friends remained ignorant that one half the
mutineers were in a state of helpless intoxication;
that their leader had received a severe wound,
which might prove mortal, and that the miserable
Hawkshaw was being butchered without mercy in
the forecastle bunks.
</p>

<p>
And so closed this night of outrage on board the
<i>Hermione</i>.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
A SNARE LAID.
</h3>

<p>
On Ethel the effects of all she had undergone&mdash;a
terror equal to the menace of death&mdash;the memory of
all she had seen, Pedro bleeding from the bullet of
Hawkshaw, and the latter torn back to be butchered
in the very den from which he had rescued her,
produced fits of hysteria and violent sickness, requiring
all the skill of Dr. Heriot to soothe and subdue
them.
</p>

<p>
For a time she lay in a fainting fit as in a deep
sleep, with her breathing so low that it could
scarcely be perceived on a mirror.  Morley was in
an agony of alarm, lest she should never wake more;
but this symptom was followed by strong convulsions,
till tears relieved and left her very weak.
</p>

<p>
However, she was able to relate at intervals what
had taken place, and how she had escaped the
mutineers; after this, she was left for a time to the
care of Nance Folgate, who was great in the use of
burnt feathers, hartshorn, and asafoetida.
</p>

<p>
With Rose, on recovering from her swoon, joy
for her sister's sudden restoration took the form of
alternate showers of tears and bursts of ringing
hysterical laughter, which were painful to hear and
difficult to allay, so, between them, the poor doctor
had his hands quite full.
</p>

<p>
Morley and his nautical friends, who had never
seen anything of this kind before, were sorely
puzzled by the turns and symptoms of Rose's
ailment; for there is but little difference sometimes
between the crying and the laughing of an hysterical
young lady.
</p>

<p>
Physical and mental exhaustion at length brought
on sleep, and Rose and Ethel lay with arms
entwined, the terrible past and the dreaded future
being alike committed to oblivion, unless when, at
intervals, the latter seemed to see, in fancy, those
grimy visages peering out from the dark berths,
freezing her with affright, and Pedro's black and
gloating eyes stupefying her with their terrible
expression.
</p>

<p>
Gradually, however, both sisters were soothed,
and calm with perfect sleep came together.
</p>

<p>
The sliding-door to the steerage was made fast by
strong screws against all attempts by that avenue
for the future.
</p>

<p>
"Well," whispered Heriot, as they withdrew into
the cabin, "matters are improving for us forward."
</p>

<p>
"How?" asked Tom Bartelot gloomily.
</p>

<p>
"Pedro Barradas has his right arm shattered&mdash;you
heard Miss Basset say so&mdash;and then there is
Hawkshaw killed and flung overboard."
</p>

<p>
"Poor wretch!" said Morley.
</p>

<p>
"Two almost out of their rogues' mess," added
Captain Phillips; "but I don't think Hawkshaw
was very warm in their cursed business."
</p>

<p>
"His poor father, jolly old Tom Hawkshaw, of
Lincoln's Inn, little foresaw an end so miserable for
his only son.  Poor Tom! how he did love that
boy!" exclaimed Mr. Basset, wringing his hands,
as he thought of his old friend.
</p>

<p>
"Judging from the state in which Miss Basset
says she found those fellows forward," said Morrison,
"I don't see why we shouldn't make an effort to
recapture the ship, and make every one of them walk
the plank."
</p>

<p>
"My very thoughts, Mr. Morrison," said Captain
Phillips, with great earnestness; "but, as yet, they
still outnumber us, and, unless by stratagem, I don't
see a way in the matter&mdash;a fair trial of strength
would only end in our own defeat."
</p>

<p>
"Something is worth tryin', sir&mdash;I'm precious
weary o' bein' bottled down here, like a rat in the
cable tier," said Noah Gawthrop, who was on his
knees, lighting, and puffing with distended cheeks,
at a fire in the cabin-grate, preparatory to boiling
coffee, for the morning was far advanced, and no
one thought of sleeping now, even on the cabin-locker;
"but you see, your honour, unless we had
'em all in the bilboes, or shoved clean overboard, we
could never be safe."
</p>

<p>
"Not even if we had them all secured in the
bunks, and the forescuttle shipped and battened
over them?" interrupted Morley.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, not even then," replied Noah very
emphatically.
</p>

<p>
"How so?"
</p>

<p>
"'Cos, if you didn't smother 'em, they'd set the
ship on fire, that all on us might go to old Davy
together.  The greatest warmints on land and sea are
them Espanoles, as comes from South 'Meriker&mdash;I
knows 'em, I does."
</p>

<p>
"Egad, Noah is right," said Tom Bartelot; "and
to get the weather-gage of these fellows we must try
some other plan than fisticuffs."
</p>

<p>
During this time the crew were all heard on deck
rumbling about, growling and uttering threats; and
by the number of seas shipped over the bows, by
the lurching and pitching of the vessel, it was
evident to those below that the wind had freshened,
and that an unsteady hand was on the wheel, as she
was yawing, and steering wild.
</p>

<p>
By noon Ethel was almost composed, and when
she reclined on her bed, with one hand clasped by
her father, another in Morley's, Rose bending over
her, and worthy young Dr. Heriot hovering about,
she felt soothed; through all her overtaxed frame
there seemed to flow a tranquillising and magnetic
influence; she almost forgot that the same ship
contained, but a few yards off, the source of her recent
terror; her over-wrought mind grew calm, and the
fever passed out of her.
</p>

<p>
"Dear papa&mdash;dear papa&mdash;kiss me.  Sit closer,
Morley dear," she said, in a sweet, low voice;
"where is your hand, Morley?"
</p>

<p>
"Here&mdash;clasped on yours, Ethel."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, papa, if poor mamma only knew of all
this!" she was beginning, when tears choked her
utterance.
</p>

<p>
"Do not think of these things," whispered Morley,
anxiously; "it is well she is not with us."
</p>

<p>
"Even her loss was merciful, though it nearly
broke my heart, for all this would have killed her,"
said Mr. Basset, in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, when will it end!&mdash;when will it end!"
sobbed Rose.
</p>

<p>
"When we reeve some of those fellows up to the
yard-arm, in the loop of a stout line," said
Dr. Heriot.  "I can't help feeling assured that we
shall weather them, yet, and my countryman,
Morrison, who, perhaps, has the gift of the second sight,
among his other accomplishments, is of the same
opinion," added Heriot, with a pleasant laugh to
raise their spirits.
</p>

<p>
Ethel felt safe comparatively&mdash;protected and
restored; but at what a price&mdash;a human life!  The
life of that misguided being who first cast a shadow
on her path.
</p>

<p>
She recalled his last words and forgave him all,
for his closing act had been one of devotion towards
herself.  But for him, she might, or must have
been, destroyed.  The imagination of all from
which he had saved her made her shudder in her
soul, and froze her very marrow!  Poor Hawkshaw,
she might almost call him now, as he had gone so
summarily to his dread account, gashed with many
a wound, and cast into the sea, without prayer, or
shroud, or grave&mdash;cast with all his sins and errors
on his head and on his soul!
</p>

<p>
She shuddered, we say, as she thought fearfully
of these dire things, and clasped more tightly the
kind hands of those who sat beside her.
</p>

<p>
Morley, too, felt that he could freely forgive
Hawkshaw now; for his nature was brave, generous,
and gentle, and he wondered whether, when dying,
that unfortunate wretch had felt what <i>he</i> endured&mdash;first,
when he was flung over Acton Chine; and,
second, when the shattered wreck of the <i>Princess</i>
parted, and he found himself, as he believed,
drowning in the water&mdash;the intense rapidity with which
thought and memory rushed through his soul, as
he hung for a moment between two lives, one to
come, and one that seemed passing away&mdash;how all
the loves and memories, faces of friends and foes,
sins of omission and commission, all the errors and
shortcomings of his existence flashed with the
rapidity of light upon his maddened mind; bodily
suffering, on those two occasions, he had none&mdash;it
was all mental, and the most acute of its kind.
</p>

<p>
Had Hawkshaw felt all this when the death-shot
rang in his ears, and the assassins' knives were
clashing in his body?
</p>

<p>
He must have felt this emotion; and Morley, with
that conviction, and the knowledge that he (Hawkshaw)
had saved Ethel Basset at the price of his own
unhappy existence, felt in his honest heart that he
could freely forgive him all the past.
</p>

<p>
But this spirit of forgiveness by no means
extended itself to Pedro Barradas, against whom he
cherished the most undying vengeance, when he
thought of the terror Ethel had suffered at his hands,
and, more than all, the horrors she had escaped.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the elder Barradas, maddened with
the agony occasioned by his shattered limb, which
none on board, save Dr. Heriot, could dress or
reduce&mdash;for the fracture was compound, the ball and
socket of the elbow being completely smashed&mdash;was
scheming out revenge and fresh outrages, which he
found a difficulty in putting in practice, as the same
wound which reduced his bodily strength, and stung
his soul with rage and pain, deprived him of the
influence he formerly exercised over his companions&mdash;an
influence that he maintained physically rather
than morally.
</p>

<p>
He supposed that they must be several miles up
the Mozambique Channel, and he remembered the
Malay proas; thus every hour rendered the necessity
greater for having entire possession of the ship
and for destroying those in the cabin, for if but one
of these escaped, he and all his companions might
yet swing as pirates, and, knowing that Mr. Basset
was a lawyer&mdash;a judge or legal functionary of high
position&mdash;caused the crew to cherish a peculiar
dread and aversion of him in particular.
</p>

<p>
There were times when, in the intervals of his
bodily and mental fury&mdash;both of which the copious
use of ardent spirits had greatly inflamed&mdash;he
conceived the idea of running the ship ashore on the
first land he made, or of setting her on fire in
mid-ocean, that all might perish, and so frequently did
he mutter of these things that Zuares, Badger,
Sharkey, and the rest, knowing the desperation of
his character, and the resolute cruelty of which he
was capable, feared that he might put his terrible
threats into execution.
</p>

<p>
As for asking Dr. Heriot to dress his wound, or
by a touch of his skill to lessen the agony that
wrung the bead-drops from his tawny brow, he
never thought of such a thing!  To expect an act
of such mercy or generosity never occurred to his
cruel mind as being within the compass of possibility;
but he now conceived and prepared to execute a very
subtle plan for gaining possession of Ethel Basset,
and through her, as hostage, compelling Heriot to
dress his shattered limb, after which he would destroy
them all without mercy; and as these ideas occurred
to him he gnashed his sharp white teeth and uttered
a roar that was something between a laugh of savage
exultation and a howl of agony.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br /><br />
MR. BASSET DELUDED.
</h3>

<p>
Noon was drawing slowly on; Ethel and Rose were
still sleeping, when the tarpaulin, or spare
mizzen-topsail, which had so long covered the skylight, was
withdrawn from above, and a flood, it seemed, of
sunny radiance, streamed into the cabin, the
occupants of which saw the blue sky overhead for
the first time these several days past.
</p>

<p>
"Below there, Captain Phillips!" cried a voice.
</p>

<p>
"Hollo! who are you that hail?"
</p>

<p>
"Bolter&mdash;Benjamin Bolter, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Well, fellow?"
</p>

<p>
"May I talk to you a'thout bein' fired on?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly; come forward."
</p>

<p>
Bolter, the Canadian, appeared at the rim of the
skylight, looking down with watery, bloodshot eyes,
a pale, unwholesome visage, and a black mouth,
furred by dissipation and squalor.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want?" demanded Captain Phillips,
with a tone of impatience and authority.
</p>

<p>
"Pedro Barradas has sent me aft to speak to you."
</p>

<p>
"About what?"
</p>

<p>
"The state o' matters aboard, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Oho! you are coming to your senses at last,
are you?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps so, sir," said Bolter, giving a covert
wink, full of sly wickedness, to Sharkey, who stood
near him on deck, unseen by those below, and with
his tongue thrust into his cheek.
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;speak out!"
</p>

<p>
"Pedro Barradas is severely wounded, sir; his
right elbow is knocked all to splinters."
</p>

<p>
"Glad to hear it; hope he may slip his cable in
the turn of a hand.  Which of his precious friends
did this for him?"
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Hawkshaw, who has been knocked on the
head and flung overboard, after a bit of a scrimmage
for'ard."
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;well?" said the captain, impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"Pedro can't come aft, sir, so he wishes one of
the gentlemen below to come for'ard, that we may
all toe a line, beg pardon for what's past, and make
some terms with you."
</p>

<p>
"Oho!"
</p>

<p>
"He says, sir," resumed the Canadian, in a
whining voice, "that he would rather have
Mr. Basset than anyone else."
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"Bein' a gentleman as is bred to the law, for
which he has a very particklar respect."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Basset grew a little pale on hearing this
selection; but, knowing how important was the stroke
that might be won by a little skilful diplomacy&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I am ready to go&mdash;ready to meet these men,
if&mdash;if&mdash;you think good will come of it, Captain
Phillips," said he, while his mind became full of apt
quotations from the Mutiny Act, "Shee's Edition
of Lord Tenterden," and so forth, for the harangue
which, mentally, he proposed to make the misguided
and&mdash;as he supposed&mdash;now repentant mutineers.
</p>

<p>
"But we have no hostage for your safety, sir,"
urged Dr. Heriot.
</p>

<p>
"Hostage&mdash;safety&mdash;am I in danger, think you?"
stammered Mr. Basset.
</p>

<p>
"The venture is not without peril.  And why
have they selected you?"
</p>

<p>
"As a legal man, and as a neutral party, I learn
from what their messenger says," replied Mr. Basset,
gathering courage as he thought of his commission
as judge in the supreme civil and criminal court of
the Isle of France.  "Shall I go, Captain Phillips?"
</p>

<p>
"If you will venture, and can succeed in bringing
back these fellows to a sense of their crimes, and of
their duty, an unspeakable boon will be conferred
on us all; but they must agree to put the leaders in
bilboes, or set them adrift in the dingy, which they
please.  They must also give up all their knives,
pistols, and other weapons."
</p>

<p>
"Of course, of course."
</p>

<p>
"See, my dear sir, at all events, what they want."
</p>

<p>
"There is one thing as we wants badly, sir," said
Bolter, twirling his tarpaulin hat, and scratching his
head; "and that is some brandy, or rum, we ain't
particklar which; and a few bottles would go a long
way to heal old sores."
</p>

<p>
"Some brandy?&mdash;granted."
</p>

<p>
"We have a gallon jar in the steward's locker,"
said Mr. Foster, the second mate.
</p>

<p>
"Then hoist it out."
</p>

<p>
Dr. Heriot anticipated Foster by opening the
locker, when he soon found the jar, which he
proceeded at once to uncork.
</p>

<p>
"Why, doctor, you don't mean to make it pay
toll, do you?" asked Tom Bartelot.
</p>

<p>
Heriot placed a finger on his lip, as if to impose
silence on the speaker, and, pouring out about a
pint of the brandy, he substituted for it the contents
of a large phial, a clear and pellucid fluid, after
which he passed up the jar into the hands of
Mr. Bolter, who received it with a very solicitous and
affectionate expression of eye.
</p>

<p>
"What, in Heaven's name, have you done, doctor&mdash;not
poisoned the stuff&mdash;eh?" asked Phillips, in a
whisper of alarm; "what was that you poured
in?"
</p>

<p>
"Morphia&mdash;strong morphia, and another powerful
narcotic&mdash;nearly all I had, too," replied the doctor,
in a similar whisper.  "It will serve to throw some
of them, at least, into a sound sleep, and thus enable
us to overpower the rest, if need be.  This will
render us independent of their terms, their
promises, and their repentance."
</p>

<p>
"Now, will Mr. Basset come on deck and meet
Pedro Barradas?" asked the Canadian, in his nasal
twang.
</p>

<p>
"Take care, my dear sir, that this is not some
lure?" said Morley, interposing.
</p>

<p>
"Lure?" repeated Mr. Basset, turning pale again.
</p>

<p>
"A snare, perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"Aye&mdash;a regular plant&mdash;they're rum chaps, these
Spaniards and Yankees," added Noah, sententiously.
</p>

<p>
"Nevertheless, I shall try," replied the good easy
man, as he thought of his two poor girls, and hoped
the time was almost come when they might be
considered comparatively safe.
</p>

<p>
"You have your revolver, sir?" asked Morley.
</p>

<p>
"All right," replied Mr. Basset, slapping his
breast confidently.
</p>

<p>
"Is it loaded?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;of course."
</p>

<p>
"Let me see it, please?"
</p>

<p>
"Whew," whistled the doctor; "my dear sir,
there is not a single cap on the nipples!"
</p>

<p>
"Bless me, you don't say so?" ejaculated poor
Mr. Basset, who looked, what he really was, as
little used to the handling of revolvers as to facing
mutineers.
</p>

<p>
Heriot examined the six chambers, and found
them all loaded; he capped the nipples, and gave
the weapon to Mr. Basset, who concealed it again in
the breast-pocket of his coat, and tried to assume a
jaunty air, but failed.
</p>

<p>
"Now then, Mr. Basset, are you goin' to be all
day of tumblin' up?" growled Bolter, stamping on
the deck.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Basset gave a wistful glance at the door of
his girls' sleeping-place, as the barricades of the
cabin were secured, and then he ascended to the
deck, with a heart that beat very fast indeed!
</p>

<p>
The dirty and disorderly state of the ship did not
strike Mr. Basset's unprofessional eye, so much as
the aspect of the crew impressed him, when he
descended from the break of the quarter-deck, and
walked forward to where Pedro Barradas was seated
on the horizontal beam of the windlass, endeavouring
to soothe himself by smoking, and in his rage half
chewing the paper cigaritos, which his brother
Zuares made for him; and close by was placed the
uncorked brandy jar, which Bolter had carried
forward, with a very triumphant expression.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Basset's heart sank, when he found himself
among these squalid desperadoes, whose persons
were now filthy in the extreme; their eyes were
wild and wolfish in expression, their faces bloated,
and obscured by sores and bruises; but still lower
would his heart have sunk, had his eye detected the
ominous noose that dangled at the weather-arm of
the foreyard!
</p>

<p>
From his seat on the windlass, Pedro Barradas
surveyed the poor gentleman, with wild black eyes,
to which the glare of passionate hate and mental
insanity, conduced by extreme bodily pain, imparted
a terrible expression.
</p>

<p>
Enveloped in bloody bandages, his right arm
hung powerless by his side.  The fingers of the
once strong hand seemed dead and livid now.  His
ear, which had been wounded by a pistol shot, was
now a festering sore, amid which his coal black hair
was matted; his bare brawny feet beat the deck
with restless impatience, and spitting out to leeward
the end of a paper cigarito, he showed all his white
glistening teeth beneath his dark moustache, on the
approach of Mr. Basset.
</p>

<p>
"Presto! come forward quick, you lubberly
scribano," he roared out.
</p>

<p>
"You wish to see me!" began Mr. Basset, in
faltering accents, for this mode of reception, and its
tone, by no means reassured him.
</p>

<p>
"To see you&mdash;yes," said Pedro, while a spasm of
agony convulsed his tawny visage; "Badger,
overhaul and lash him fast!" he suddenly exclaimed.
</p>

<p>
On hearing this alarming order, the meaning of
which he imperfectly understood, Mr. Basset was
about to rush away; but the powerful hand of the
gigantic Yankee was inserted in his collar, and
others were busy about his person: thus he was
speedily deprived of his watch, rings, and the
revolver, the appearance of which excited a shout of
derisive laughter.
</p>

<p>
Then, almost before he knew where he was,
Bolter, the Canadian, had tied his wrists together
with a piece of cord.
</p>

<p>
"Now, stranger, yew air fixed proper, I reckon&mdash;you
air," snivelled the Yankee, with a broad grin;
"Jeerusalem! yew air in an almighty fright!"
</p>

<p>
"He shall be yet in a greater," said Pedro, in a
husky voice; "where is the line from the yard-arm?"
</p>

<p>
"Here," said Zuares, as a rope was suddenly cast
over Mr. Basset's head, and looped round his
neck&mdash;a rope which, while his blood ran cold, he saw
came down from a block at the yard-arm.
</p>

<p>
"Lash another line to him for a down-haul,"
said Pedro.
</p>

<p>
And Badger did so instantly, by looping a rope
round Mr. Basset's ankles.
</p>

<p>
"My God!  my God!&mdash;my good men," he said,
in trembling accents; "you do not&mdash;you, you cannot&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Mean to hang you, eh?  Yes, but we do,"
grinned Pedro.
</p>

<p>
"Yaas&mdash;yaas, Massa Basset, we'll make you dance
ebber so 'igh," added Quaco, with a yelling laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Silence, you black devil," roared Pedro, gnashing
his teeth; "who gave you leave to speak here.
Away to the caboose, and look after your coppers.
Yes, Mr. Basset, we mean to hang you unless
Dr. Heriot will come forward and dress my wounded
arm.  And more than that&mdash;unless your two girls
come forward here among us, to ransom you.  Do
you understand all that, eh?"
</p>

<p>
Mute with fear, and the awful dread of impending
death, and such a death&mdash;feeling all the futility
of seeking mercy from the merciless&mdash;the unhappy
Mr. Basset stood in a cold sweat before this demon
of a man.  He had but one idea prominent amid
the chaos of his thoughts, that never more would
he look upon the faces of his children.
</p>

<p>
"Pass the word aft that the rope is knotted and
rove," said the inexorable Pedro.
</p>

<p>
Badger ascended the break of the quarter-deck,
and peeping down the skylight, said:
</p>

<p>
"You below thar?"
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;hallo&mdash;what do you want?" asked
Captain Phillips.
</p>

<p>
"Jest to say, friends, as Captain Barradas will
string your precious judge up to the arm of the
fore-yard in a brace o' shakes, if yew, Dr. Heriot,
don't come forward and dress his wounded arm" (at
these words, the proposal he heard of chaining him
to the mast, flashed upon Heriot's memory), "and
if yew all don't give up the tew gals you reckon on
keeping for yourselves.  If yew understand all that,
yew had better be quick, yew had."
</p>

<p>
"Be off, you rascally Yankee, or I'll mar your
seamanship!" said Captain Phillips.
</p>

<p>
"I hope to crop that rascal's auricular appendages
before we part," said Heriot, in a voice not
unlike a groan.
</p>

<p>
"Wa-al, lookye here, be quick, I say," resumed
Badger, in a nasal twang, "for Pedro's in a very
bad humour to-day, and there'll be an almighty
airthquake aboard in another minute."
</p>

<p>
The words, the manner, and bearing of this
fellow created great consternation in the cabin.
More than once had Morley levelled the barrel of
his pistol at Badger's head, but paused, with his
finger throbbing on the trigger, and fearing to fire,
lest, by doing so, he might jeopardise the father of
Ethel.
</p>

<p>
"Are the girls coming?" said Pedro, in a low
voice of concentrated passion and pain, when
Badger returned.
</p>

<p>
"Never&mdash;never, assassin and coward!" exclaimed
Mr. Basset; "destroy me, if you will&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;oh,
Heaven!&mdash;oh, my poor girls!"
</p>

<p>
He hung his head and wept, as his voice failed
him, in the excess of his misery.
</p>

<p>
"Hang the judge&mdash;hang him!" said the short,
squat ruffian, Sharkey, as he danced a hornpipe
with a vigorous double shuffle round their pale
victim; "no doubt he hopes to hang us some day."
</p>

<p>
This idea was conclusive.
</p>

<p>
"Mercy!  Listen to me, good fellows&mdash;listen!"
cried poor Mr. Basset, starting wildly, as the rope
began to tighten.  "Mercy&mdash;save me, save
me&mdash;Morley, Captain Phillips!"
</p>

<p>
Pedro's eyes filled with their most dangerous
gleam.  Despite the agony of his shattered arm,
in his hatred of law, lawyers, order, and persons in
authority, he almost smiled at the idea of thus
degrading and executing a legal functionary.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ahorcar! ahorcar!</i>&mdash;to the yard-arm with <i>el
Senor Juez</i>!  Away with him, and aft with the line!"
he exclaimed, in a hoarse voice, as the crew tallied
on and ran aft with a derisive cheer, and, at the
same moment, Mr. Basset was swung strangling off
his feet, and run, with a violent jerk, to the arm of
the foreyard to windward, where the unhappy man,
hanging, in strong convulsions, and in all the
agonies of death, presented a horrible spectacle to
Morley Ashton, who had crept up the companion-stair
and peeped out.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Father of Mercy!" he exclaimed, and sank
almost fainting on his knees, incapable for a few
moments of action or speech.
</p>

<p>
After hanging thus for several minutes, the body
of Mr. Basset was lowered with another jerk,
brought on board by the down-haul attached to the
ankles, and, amid loud yells of derisive laughter, it
was flung into the cabin through the still open
skylight, just as Morley, deathly pale, and trembling
in every limb, tottered back to tell what he had
seen on deck.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br /><br />
LUX VENIT AB ALTO.
</h3>

<p>
Pity for Mr. Basset, and intense commiseration for
his two daughters, soon gave place in the hearts of
his friends to a dire longing for vengeance on the
treacherous authors of this new atrocity.
</p>

<p>
"Secure the door, Morley&mdash;quick, or they may
be on us!" cried Heriot, as he threw off his coat
and rolled up his shirt-sleeves.
</p>

<p>
"There is no danger of their attacking us,"
replied Morley Ashton, panting and breathless.
</p>

<p>
"Why so?" asked Phillips, with an oath.
</p>

<p>
"Because these wretches are already busy with
the brandy jar."
</p>

<p>
"All the better," replied the Scotch doctor, with
a sombre frown.  "Keep your pistols and the gun
ready&mdash;pot the first villain who comes within range
through the skylight.  Poor Mr. Basset! poor
Mr. Basset!  Bartelot and Morrison, assist me, please;
we have work to do&mdash;quick, before the ladies awake
and hear us."
</p>

<p>
The body of Mr. Basset was laid on Captain
Phillips's bed, and the hateful rope which still
compressed his throat, together with the cord that
secured his wrists, was cut off and flung away by
Heriot's ready hand.
</p>

<p>
Blackened, swollen in features, and horribly
disfigured, with protruding eyes and tongue, few
would have recognised, save by his dress, the bland
and smiling smooth-skinned, close-shaved, and rather
florid gentleman of a few minutes ago.
</p>

<p>
"Dead&mdash;quite dead!" groaned Morley, as he
hung over him; "my poor friend&mdash;oh, my poor
friend! so kind&mdash;so gentle&mdash;so amiable!"
</p>

<p>
"What a fate his has been!" added Tom Bartelot.
</p>

<p>
"And who is to tell it to his poor girls?" said
Morrison.
</p>

<p>
"Ethel, at least," whispered Heriot with a
significant glance at Morley, "must be kept as long as
possible in ignorance; after the shock of last night
to know of this might have a most serious effect
upon her nervous system."
</p>

<p>
"Papa, papa, speak with me, please!" they heard
her soft, pleasant voice say at that moment.
</p>

<p>
"Say what you will or can, Ashton; but Miss
Basset must not see her father yet," said Heriot,
hastily; "the shock, as I have said, might be
dangerous, for his aspect is terrible."
</p>

<p>
"Speak to me, dear papa, for one moment.  I
have had such a horrible dream, and all about you,"
she said again.
</p>

<p>
Amid the deep muttered expressions of rage and
commiseration made by his companions, Morley,
pale and trembling, tapped at her cabin door, and,
opening it a little way, whispered that Mr. Basset
was asleep, and must not be disturbed.
</p>

<p>
"Must not," she repeated with alarm; "is papa
ill?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no; but&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But what?"
</p>

<p>
"Only in a deep sleep," he replied, with a sigh of
bitterness, as he closed the door, fearing to excite
her alarm further.
</p>

<p>
"Is this fatal outrage completed?&mdash;is the poor
gentleman quite dead?" asked Captain Phillips, in
a low and impressive voice.
</p>

<p>
"I fear so, I fear so," replied Heriot, with
growing agitation; "I can detect no sign whatever of
life, and even warmth is passing away."
</p>

<p>
"But remember, doctor," said Morrison, earnestly
and anxiously, "that the time of&mdash;of strangulation
was short, and death by being run up to the yardarm
is not so instantaneous as by the drop from a
regular scaffold ashore."
</p>

<p>
"Of course, Morrison, I know that; but&mdash;&mdash;"
the doctor paused, and shook his head sadly.
</p>

<p>
"Horrible difference!" thought Morley, with a
shudder of mingled rage and grief, while he
clenched his teeth and hands.
</p>

<p>
"But our poor friend was a heavy man and of a
full habit.  He is already becoming cold.  No
breath&mdash;no pulsation," added Heriot, placing his
hand on Mr. Basset's heart.
</p>

<p>
"Quite dead, you think?" asked Morley, whose
eyes filled with tears, as the memory of happy years
long past, and sincere pity for the two girls, rushed
into his mind.
</p>

<p>
"Beyond hope, I fear," muttered Heriot, who,
however, still continued, mechanically, as it were,
to feel the pulse and chafe the rigid limbs.
</p>

<p>
"The scoundrels&mdash;the black-hearted scoundrels!
Oh, to have revenge for all this!" exclaimed Captain
Phillips, stamping his feet on the cabin floor.
</p>

<p>
"Our numbers decrease.  First we lost poor
Manfredi, then Joe, the steward, then Sam Quail,
and now Mr. Basset," said Foster, the second mate;
"whose turn will it be next?"
</p>

<p>
"Hush!&mdash;remember the young ladies," said
Heriot, looking up, warningly.
</p>

<p>
Cold nearly, ghastly pale, where not livid and
discoloured, and rendered horrible in feature by past
convulsions, poor Mr. Basset's case seemed, indeed,
hopeless; yet Leslie Heriot, inspired by his love for
Rose, by perhaps something of the dogged perseverance
of his country, by the regard he really bore
Mr. Basset, and an enthusiasm for his profession,
with a reliance on his own skill, which was by no
means small; imbued, we say, by all these, he felt
inclined to attempt something unusual in his art,
and proceeded at once to put it in practice.
</p>

<p>
As the idea of struggling with death, of restoring
life and animation to that still and corpse-like form,
occurred to him, a sudden light shone in the
handsome young doctor's eyes; his cheek flushed, and
there was a charming brightness and animation in
all his features, as he bustled about, and unlocked
the medicine-chest and case of instruments.
</p>

<p>
"At all events I will try, I will try," he muttered
to himself; "in great attempts 'tis glorious e'en, to
fail."
</p>

<p>
He perceived that blood oozed out from a cut in
the forehead, received when the body of their victim
was flung by the mutineers through the skylight
into the cabin.
</p>

<p>
The sight of this blood gave him fresh hope, and
he commenced operations at once, and with confident
determination, while those around, who had
never witnessed such a scene, or heard of such an
attempt before, beheld him with wonder, and obeyed
all his orders with alacrity.
</p>

<p>
With his love for Rose, and his medical enthusiasm,
there mingled something of religious fervour
and much of human kindness, and selecting
carefully a lancet, he almost uttered a prayer of hope, as
he opened the temporal artery, and then the external
jugular&mdash;a vein which runs along the neck, just
beneath the skin, and returns the blood from the
head to the heart; but he sighed with doubt on
finding the circulation stopped in both, and that a
little coagulated blood only appeared at each
orifice.
</p>

<p>
With the assistance of Morley and Tom Bartelot,
he stripped the body in haste, and proceeded to rub
the back, mouth, and neck vigorously, with volatile
salts and fine oil.
</p>

<p>
When they grew weary, Captain Phillips and
Mr. Foster relieved them, and the arms and legs were
well lubricated in the same fashion, to restore and
promote circulation.
</p>

<p>
Puffs of strong tobacco were blown up the nostrils
and into the mouth, when these were compressed;
but an hour and more elapsed without any sign of
returning animation, and even Heriot was beginning
to despair (as his companions had done long before)
when, after making a small incision in the skin of
the windpipe, through which, with his own breath,
he sought to inflate the lungs, by breathing
strongly through a cannula, a cry of joy escaped him.
</p>

<p>
The blood from the temporal artery was now
trickling down the pale, discoloured face!
</p>

<p>
Heriot snatched up Mr. Basset's right hand, and
applied his fingers to the wrist.
</p>

<p>
"The pulse&mdash;the pulse begins to beat!" he exclaimed;
"quick, Morley!&mdash;place that bottle of
sal-ammoniac under his nostrils."
</p>

<p>
Morley did so, and soon an exclamation escaped
from all, on beholding Mr. Basset open and close
each eye alternately.
</p>

<p>
He was then raised up in the kind and sturdy
arms of Noah Gawthrop, while Heriot poured some
warm brandy-and-water down his throat; after
which a sound like a groan left his lips.
</p>

<p>
"Victory! blessed be God!" exclaimed Heriot,
as he struck his hands together, and thought of
Rose Basset, with her sweet loving smiles, and an
honest moisture dimmed his eyes; "he lives, after
all!"
</p>

<p>
"Thanks to your skill, doctor," said Tom Bartelot;
"the world should hear of this."
</p>

<p>
"Nay&mdash;no thanks to me," replied Heriot; "what
used we to learn at school, Morrison?  <i>Lux venit ab
alto!</i>"
</p>

<p>
"'All light comes from above,'" translated
Morrison, without hesitation.
</p>

<p>
A low wail beside them made all turn from the
bed whereon the body lay, and, to their dismay,
they beheld Ethel standing near, pale as death,
mute and rigid, her large dark eyes dilated with
blank horror and bewilderment, while surveying the
scene before her, as if she strove, but failed, to
realise or understand it.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW.
</h3>

<p>
"Ah, Miss Basset; leave us&mdash;do leave us, for
Heaven's sake&mdash;this is no scene for you!" said
Heriot, half imperatively, half entreatingly.  "Ashton,
I can ill spare you, but do lead her away.  Tell her
all, if you choose, now.  There is, I hope, no
further fear."
</p>

<p>
Morley put his arms round Ethel, and lifted her
back into her cabin.
</p>

<p>
Still she did not speak, though her pale lips and
inquiring eyes showed how eagerly she sought an
explanation of the terrible scene formed by the
busy group; but Morley was silent, for he knew not
how to begin, and contented himself by repeating,
as people usually do, that she must compose herself,
be calm, and so forth.
</p>

<p>
"Compose myself for what?" she asked,
suddenly.  "What has happened?&mdash;who is injured?
Not papa&mdash;not my papa, surely?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Ethel, your papa," replied Morley, retaining
her hands firmly in his own.
</p>

<p>
She uttered a cry, and was breaking from him,
when he restrained her in his arms.
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me, Ethel&mdash;dear Ethel, pardon me," he
continued to repeat; "your father has suffered much
maltreatment at the hands of those villains on deck;
but Dr. Heriot has nearly restored him&mdash;a little
time, and he shall tell you all about it himself."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," she sobbed, and, overcome by emotion,
dropped her head on Morley's shoulder; "my
father&mdash;my loved papa!"
</p>

<p>
And, as she spoke, how convulsively the white
bosom heaved.
</p>

<p>
Impulsive, and wildly energetic, Rose Basset now
tried to escape from the cabin; but Morley placed
his back against the door, and strove to soothe and
to retain her.
</p>

<p>
At first, it would appear that Ethel had not
recognised her father in that stripped man, whose face
was swollen, streaked with blood, and livid by recent
strangulation; and thus, unobserved, she had
overlooked the operations of Heriot for nearly a minute
in silent bewilderment and alarm.
</p>

<p>
She was almost fainting again on learning that
this helpless patient was her father, but gathered
courage from the energy of Rose, who kept
incessantly repeating:
</p>

<p>
"Let me out, Morley&mdash;let me go to papa!  I
must&mdash;I shall get out!  Mr. Ashton, will you dare
to keep me from papa, who is ill?"
</p>

<p>
Then Ethel joined with her, and insisted so touchingly
and so vehemently, that Morley was compelled
to yield, and they rushed to the bedside of
Mr. Basset, just as Heriot and Tom Bartelot placed him
in a comfortable sitting posture, well bolstered up,
and covered with warm blankets, where he sat
breathing heavily; but with his eyes closed, and his
head reclining on the shoulder of the young doctor,
in whose face there shone a bright smile of joy and
triumph.
</p>

<p>
"Papa, papa, speak to me!" cried Ethel, in a
piercing voice, as she thrust herself between Captain
Phillips and Tom Bartelot, knelt by the side of the
bed&mdash;which was nearly level with the cabin-floor&mdash;and
stroked his brow with a delicate and tremulous
hand, while caressingly she drew his head upon her
own breast; "you are not dying, papa&mdash;you cannot
be dying! oh, say so&mdash;speak to your own Ethel!"
</p>

<p>
A slight quivering of the eyelids, and, if possible,
a heavier respiration, was his sole response.
</p>

<p>
Again she spoke to him more imploringly, and
this time the head was raised for a moment, but
only to drop more heavily on her bosom.
</p>

<p>
"Will he die?&mdash;will he die?&mdash;speak, Leslie!"
exclaimed Rose, while wringing her hands.
</p>

<p>
"No, not if my skill, with God's blessing, can
save him, Rose.  He is recovering rapidly."
</p>

<p>
"But recovering from what?" asked Ethel,
shrilly; "what manner of ailment or maltreatment
is this?"
</p>

<p>
"Himself will tell you all about it to-morrow;
to-day he must sleep&mdash;I say must, my dear Miss
Basset," said Heriot, in an impressive whisper.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, that by dying I could save my papa&mdash;my
own dear papa!" cried Rose, as she rocked herself
to and fro, her eyes streaming with tears the while.
</p>

<p>
"Don't talk so, Rose," said Heriot, almost
angrily; "people can do more good by living than
by dying, so, if you are determined to stay here, let
us see what a dear little nurse you can make.  There
is no assistant a medical man appreciates so much
as a capital nurse; so look alive, you little
fairy&mdash;end this bother, and squeeze that sponge."
</p>

<p>
Heriot's cheerful and confident manner did more
to soothe and reassure Ethel and Rose than all the
friendly hopes expressed by the others&mdash;even by
Morley Ashton.  Ethel patted him on the cheek
and kissed him, and bluff Captain Phillips too;
which made old Noah Gawthrop's eyes begin to
twinkle, and he wiped his mouth with the sleeve of
his jacket, and thrust his quid of pigtail into a
remote corner of his jaws, in the hope that his turn
would come in time.
</p>

<p>
"There is a crisis in the life of everybody;"
Ethel Basset had passed that crisis, but it had been
one of woe and terror.  She had passed, as it were,
through a tempest of emotions and alarms of
late&mdash;emotions that had separated her from her girlish
life, strengthened her mental powers, and developed
her faculties.  So she sought to brace up her
energies for trials that might yet be to come&mdash;to be
a woman of action, rather than, like poor little
Rose, a girl of thoughts and tears.
</p>

<p>
So now she bent all the energies of life and
affection to nursing her father, upon whom, as the
evening deepened, a heavy slumber stole; thus,
left by his side, alone&mdash;Rose had fallen asleep,
exhausted&mdash;she sat and watched, heedless of her
friends, who were occupied elsewhere, and heedless
whether the ship was becalmed, or rushing before a
gale of wind.
</p>

<p>
Ethel remembered the death of her mother, and
the dull stunning sense of a mighty and unwonted
calamity and loss&mdash;the yawning of a chasm that
never more would close; the hushing of a familiar
voice that would never more be heard; the passing
away of a beloved face, that would never more be
seen; and she remembered the calm aspect of the
corpse disposed in its coffin, lined with white satin,
laid on her own bed, with white curtains, draped
up&mdash;the same bed in which all her children had been
born, around which they had all hovered for weeks
in the close atmosphere of a sick room, hushed into
silence and on tiptoe, and about which they had
all knelt with bowed heads, as the spirit that had
lingered for hours between eternity and time fled at
last on its mysterious and unknown journey; and
Ethel felt that then she could pray.
</p>

<p>
Now she knelt by her father's side, in that little
and confined cabin, where no sound reached her but
his deep breathing, and the jarring of the night-lamp
that swung from the beam above, and swayed
to and fro as the ship rolled, casting weird gleams
alike on the pale face of the watcher, and the
discoloured features of the sleeper; but she, more
stunned and more bewildered than ever, had neither
words nor language, nor, at times, coherent thought
in her soul, yet that soul was full of a dumb,
despairing entreaty of Heaven, but in what form she
neither knew nor felt, and scarcely did the chaos of
her mind enable her to know what she would ask.
</p>

<p>
Rose was not with her now, we have said.
</p>

<p>
Poor child, her grief was noisy, and full of tears,
so she had long since cried herself to sleep beside
old Nance Folgate.
</p>

<p>
"Is not all this some phantasmagoria, or am I
turning mad?" thought Ethel.  "Why am I so far
away from Laurel Lodge&mdash;far away upon this world
of waters, and enduring all these miseries?  Ah, my
God! if all these should be but the dreams of
insanity?"
</p>

<p>
She feared this all the more that, by some
idiosyncrasy of the human mind, amid the horror of her
great grief, she was haunted, almost tormented, by
a frivolous song and air she used to sing at home.
</p>

<p>
Why was this, and how was this?  The number
of brass rings on the curtain rods, the gyrations of
the flies, that buzzed about the night-lamp and
clustered on the beams overhead, the knots in the
wainscot, that seemed, especially when in shadow,
to become quaint and freakish faces, all mingled
with the memory of this song, which struggled for
mastery with the prayers she sought to say, and
with the awful idea that her father was dying, and
that he and she were alone together in that fatal
ship upon the midnight sea.
</p>

<p>
Anon, the singular and most unwonted silence
that reigned around her, the absence of all sounds
in the cabin, roused her at last to external objects.
</p>

<p>
She looked out of the little state-room in which
her father lay; the cabin was empty; Morley,
Bartelot, Captain Phillips, and all were gone!
</p>

<p>
She looked at her watch; the time was a quarter
to twelve.  Midnight was at hand.
</p>

<p>
New and vague terrors seized her; she ran to her
own cabin, and found Rose still asleep beside their
old nurse.
</p>

<p>
"Morley!" cried Ethel, in great alarm; "Morley! where
are you?"
</p>

<p>
But the cabin was dark; she received no answer,
and heard no sound but the regulated clatter of the
rudder in its case, and the wind whistling drearily
through the mizzentop.
</p>

<p>
Ere this a great change had taken place on board
the <i>Hermione</i>; but the relation of what had occurred
deserves a chapter to itself.
</p>

<p><a id="chap09"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br /><br />
THE QUARTER-BOAT AND ITS FREIGHT.
</h3>

<p>
The silence below was caused simply by the
circumstance&mdash;a somewhat unusual one now&mdash;of all her
friends being <i>on deck</i>.
</p>

<p>
They had recovered complete possession of the
half-dismantled ship.
</p>

<p>
So busy had they all been about the restoration
of Mr. Basset, that they heard nothing of the ribald
songs, the wild uproar, and systematic noise of the
crew, who were all clustered forward about the
forecastle and windlass-bitts&mdash;a coarse and brutish
hilarity induced by the contents of the brandy jar.
Of this they had all freely partaken; none more so,
perhaps, than Pedro Barradas, to deaden or drown
the sense of agony he endured in his wounded arm,
which was now bringing on a species of remorse for
the past, and that emotion he sedulously sought to
lull or stifle too.
</p>

<p>
An unnatural stillness succeeding the uproar which
had reigned so long on deck, attracted, however, the
attention of Captain Phillips and Tom Bartelot;
and, as Mr. Basset had now been consigned to the
care of Ethel, they began to confer with the rest
about the probable results of the jar of drugged
brandy.
</p>

<p>
"The scoundrels, I believe, are all asleep, or dead
drunk," suggested Dr. Heriot; "I was not particular
to a scruple about the morphia and belladonna
I poured in."
</p>

<p>
"Then now is our time to retake the ship, and
send every one of them to leeward," said Captain
Phillips, starting up from the cabin-locker.  "Look
to your pistols, my good friends, and follow me."
</p>

<p>
The barricades were removed from the cabin-door,
and those who had been so long imprisoned below
crept up the companion-stairs, and peeped out in
succession.
</p>

<p>
Overhead "the blue, wide shell of the sky," as
Ossian names it, was clear and starry, and the
waning moon, cold, pale, and white, shone over
the calm, still ocean from the horizon, casting the
weird shadow of the ship far to the westward, over
the silvered sea.
</p>

<p>
The <i>Hermione</i> was almost becalmed, and most
fortunately for the safety of all.  Her fore and
main courses, with a single neglected reef in each,
hung motionless, like two great tablecloths on a
clothes-line.  Unhoisted, the jib and fore-staysail,
"lay in a blessed ruck," as Noah phrased it, each at
the foot of the stays.  The driver was brailed up,
and its gaff and boom swayed idly to and fro.  The
deck was encumbered by spars, yards, bundles of
sails, half-coiled ropes, and much of the debris
that had come down from aloft when the ship
broached to on the night of the mutiny, together
with casks, boxes, sacks, empty bottles, and other
things which had been brought out of the hold, one
of the hatches of which was still open; and thus
the disordered ship was floating like a log upon the
water, at the mercy of any sudden squall or gale,
her abandoned wheel, revolving some four or five
spokes from port to starboard ever and anon, with
an impatient jerk as the rudder grated from side to
side on its iron pintles, though it had been "made
fast," in a very loose fashion, by the steersman.
</p>

<p>
Near it lay that official, a seaman named William
Cribbet, asleep, in a stupor apparently, so Noah
pulled a few fathoms of stout yarn from his pocket,
sprang upon him with an exclamation which was
not quite a benediction, turned him on his face, and
in a trice lashed his hands hard and fast behind his
back.
</p>

<p>
Proceeding forward, they found fifteen or sixteen
of the crew lying about the break of the forecastle,
under the long-boat, or near the windlass-bitts, some
on pieces of sail, and others on the bare deck; but
all asleep, or snorting in a state of idiotic
intoxication.  Broken in pieces, and scattered about were
fragments of the brandy-jar, the contents of which
brought all this to pass.
</p>

<p>
Each man in succession they tied securely, though
one or two attempted to resist, even when the cold
muzzle of a cocked pistol was pressed against their
ears; and others began to threaten and revile their
captors, as the operation of binding roused, and
partially sobered them.  At last every man was
bound and at their mercy.
</p>

<p>
"What are we to do with them now, Captain
Phillips?" asked Morley.
</p>

<p>
"Short-handed as we are, we can never work the
ship, even dismantled as she is, and watch and cook
for all these villains, too," said Mr. Foster; "and
as for trusting 'em again&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Trust them again&mdash;cook for them indeed!"
exclaimed Captain Phillips; "cook for a gang of
pirates and murderers&mdash;feed up what ought to be
hung!  It is a mercy from Heaven that no breeze
or gale came on ere this, for we must have foundered
then, and all gone to the bottom together.  No,
Mr. Foster; I shall neither keep them nor feed
them, but overboard they shall go, every man and
mother's son!"
</p>

<p>
"Drown them, do you mean?" asked Tom
Bartelot, with anxious surprise.
</p>

<p>
"No, for that might cause an unpleasant
imputation on us all."
</p>

<p>
"What then?"
</p>

<p>
"I mean simply to maroon the whole gang.  They
shall have a chance for their worthless lives; but
not aboard my ship."
</p>

<p>
"On an island&mdash;there should be several hereabout,
that is, if we are near Madagascar," observed
Bartelot.
</p>

<p>
"No, I shall not wait for the chance of sighting
land, but will sacrifice my good quarter-boat, and
with it get rid of them all.  Noah Gawthrop, jump
into the quarter-boat and clear the fall tackle.
Mr. Morrison and Mr. Ashton, please to cast
off&mdash;stand by to lower away and bring her alongside."
</p>

<p>
"Under the mizzen-chains?" asked Morley.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, round here to the port-side."
</p>

<p>
This order was promptly obeyed, for anything
like freedom became a luxury now.  Quickly the
double-sheaved blocks revolved as the davits swung
round and tackles fell; then the boat was speedily
made fast by Noah to the side-chains by the bow-rope.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Foster," said Captain Phillips, "get up a
gang-cask of fresh water, and also a few dozen of
biscuit from the cabin-locker.  More food or mercy
these piratical wretches shall not have from me;
and now let us all bear a hand, for I feel that
coolness in the air which always precedes a breeze; so
we have no time to lose.  Search and disarm every
man; then chuck them into the boat, and cut it
adrift."
</p>

<p>
The first who was collared and dragged over the
side was he whom Heriot had so peppered with the
fowling-piece, that, as Noah said, "his face looked
like plum-duff, with currants, on a Christmas-day."
</p>

<p>
A sheath-knife was taken from his belt; he was
then half-lifted, half-flung into the boat, where he
lay across the thwarts, kicking and blaspheming,
but unable either to resist or pick himself up.
</p>

<p>
"Who comes next?" asked the captain.
</p>

<p>
"Cribbet, who was steering."
</p>

<p>
"Cribbet, who was sleeping rather.  Over with
him.  Who is the next?'
</p>

<p>
"Badger, the Yankee," replied Foster.
</p>

<p>
"Give me his pistols," said Phillips, who, with
his new purpose, had resumed his tone of authority.
</p>

<p>
"Now, airthquakes and sherry-cobbler! wot air
yew up to?" he stammered out.  "I say, shipmates&mdash;hallo!
Vast heaving, yew bloated Britishers!"
</p>

<p>
"Heave with a will!  In with him&mdash;over with him!"
</p>

<p>
And in a trice this long-legged son of Columbia
was sprawling over the thwarts below.
</p>

<p>
The idea of cropping Badger's ears actually
occurred to Heriot; but he dismissed it as too
barbarous and unworthy, even while remembering all
the man's rascality.
</p>

<p>
"What son of Old Scratch is this?" asked
Morrison, dragging one from under the
gallows-bitts, abaft the foremast.
</p>

<p>
"Sharkey, with Mr. Basset's revolver in his belt."
</p>

<p>
"The ugly villain!"
</p>

<p>
"The murderer of my friend Manfredi, captain,"
said Heriot, with mingled sadness and loathing.
</p>

<p>
"An out-and-out ticket-o'-leaver," added Noah,
squirting his quid into Sharkey's eye, as he was cast
into the boat with a lurch that nearly overset it;
"we should lynch him at the yard-arm, captain,
that we should."
</p>

<p>
"Quaco, the cook, next.  Heave ahead, darkey,"
said Foster.
</p>

<p>
"Yaas, yaas, Master Foster!" grinned the negro,
who was helplessly intoxicated, and but partially
awake.
</p>

<p>
"Black in heart, and black in face."
</p>

<p>
"Bolter!  Come along, you traitorous scoundrel!"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Benjamin Bolter, who was more sober than
the rest, kicked vigorously, and nearly fell into the
sea, in which case he must have sunk like a stone,
as his arms were tied, and neither friends nor foes
could have saved him; but such were the comments
made by the recaptors of the ship, as the mutineers
were flung over the side into the boat, like so many
sacks of wool or flour.
</p>

<p>
Zuares, who seemed in a perfect stupor, came last.
There were taken from them the revolver, of which
Mr. Basset had been deprived, with his watch and
rings, six old brass-barrelled pistols, and about a
dozen sheath-knives.
</p>

<p>
"Pedro Barradas&mdash;where is Pedro?" asked Captain
Phillips, suddenly; "every rascal is in the boat
but he."
</p>

<p>
"He is not on deck, sir," said Mr. Foster.
</p>

<p>
"Can he have been killed&mdash;or has he jumped overboard?"
</p>

<p>
"Not likely the last&mdash;he is too cowardly to die if
he can help it."
</p>

<p>
"Search the bunks forward&mdash;lose no time."
</p>

<p>
"Aye, aye, sir."
</p>

<p>
There Pedro was found and dragged forth.  He
offered no resistance, but moaned heavily, and hung
lifeless in their hands.
</p>

<p>
"Hoist the carrion up, and over with him," said
Captain Phillips, who, though naturally one of the
kindest and jolliest of men, seemed, for the time, to
be hardened and pitiless, as he said, "all mercy had
been quite squeezed out of him."
</p>

<p>
"Stop, if you please," said Heriot, who looked
earnestly at Pedro's eyes, and felt his pulse; "we
must not be quite so merciless to them as they
would have been to us."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean, doctor?" asked Phillips,
impatiently.
</p>

<p>
"This man is dying," replied Heriot.
</p>

<p>
"Dying!" repeated all, drawing near.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;look here," said Heriot.
</p>

<p>
And certainly Pedro's face, when viewed by the
cold, clear light of the waning moon, presented a
most striking and appalling aspect.  His features
were regular, even handsome; his black eyes, that
nearly met over the long and well-cut nose, seemed
darker now; his tawny hue was gone, and a death-like
tint, as of white marble, had replaced it, forming
a singular contrast to the intense blackness of his
beard, moustache, and curly hair; his lower jaw had
fallen, his eyes were almost closed, his respirations
were heavy and uncertain, his pulse was low and
sinking, and he drooped helplessly in the arms of
Foster and Morrison, who had dragged him to the
port gangway.
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure of what you say, doctor?" asked
Captain Phillips, earnestly.
</p>

<p>
"Quite, sir; ah! these terrible signs are not to
be mistaken."
</p>

<p>
"Then, how long do you think he may live?"
</p>

<p>
"Till midday to-morrow&mdash;certainly not until midnight."
</p>

<p>
"In that case," said Captain Phillips, turning to
the others, after a pause, during which much
reviling and growling were heard alongside, "we
must temper justice with mercy.  Our own safety
requires that we must rid ourselves of those rascals;
but this one, although the worst and leader of them
all, may remain on board, and die at his leisure.
Stow him away in the bunks, Foster; and, doctor,
give him a touch of your skill."
</p>

<p>
"If he lives?"
</p>

<p>
"He shall be hanged at Port Louis, and, if
he dies, why then he becomes what he would
have made each one of us&mdash;food for Jack
Shark."
</p>

<p>
Morrison and Foster carried Pedro back into the
forecastle, and deposited him in one of the most
comfortable bunks&mdash;one of those farthest from the
cutwater and heel of the bowsprit, and there, soon
after, Heriot came to attend him.
</p>

<p>
"Now in with the gang-cask and the biscuits,"
said Captain Phillips; "look alive about it, Foster.
I feel a puff of wind, so we must soon attend to the
ship; throw them in a couple of oars, they can
unlash one another when sober, and pull whichever
way they please.  Now, cut off the painter, Noah,
and set the mutinous spawn adrift."
</p>

<p>
Promptly as the captain could have wished Noah
cast-off the painter; but the boat still clung close
to the mizzen-chains, and jarred&mdash;on the principle of
attraction&mdash;against the vessel's side.
</p>

<p>
"Take a boot-hook, Noah, and shove her clear
off the counter," said Morrison, looking over the
side.  "By the way the rudder hangs, there is a
strong current running here, and that will soon
drift her clear of the ship."
</p>

<p>
The boat, with its as yet helpless load of
ruffianism, was soon shoved astern of the <i>Hermione</i>,
and, as Morrison foretold, it rapidly drifted
away on the starboard quarter.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, imagine what those fellows may&mdash;nay,
must&mdash;endure, when they all become sober after so many
days and nights of almost ceaseless intoxication!"
said Heriot, looking after the boat with very little
commiseration in his eye or voice, as it rose and fell
on the long glassy rollers that glittered in the full
sheen of the waning moon, whose disc was dipping
now at the horizon, and sending from thence a path
of dazzling light across the ocean.  "Sea and sky
will be round them," continued the doctor.  "As
the ballad says:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Water, water everywhere,<br />
  Yet not a drop to drink!'"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Aye, yer honour; the contents o' that 'ere
gang-cask won't last 'em long," said Noah with a grin.
</p>

<p>
"The poor wretches will go mad!" said Morley,
who thought of his own sufferings on the wreck.
</p>

<p>
"Mad?" repeated Noah.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; and drink each other's blood, perhaps.  I
have read of such things."
</p>

<p>
"And I've heard of such things, many times, in
forecastle yarns; but as for men positively eating
one another&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"They may do so, and welcome, Noah," interrupted
Captain Phillips, who was surveying, with
increasing wrath, the disordered and dilapidated
state of his once beautiful ship, the pride of his
owners, and the pet of his heart.
</p>

<p>
Already half-sobered, or becoming aware of their
situation, some of the crew began to shout and hail
the ship, particularly Badger.
</p>

<p>
"Lookey har, capting!  Halloo, yew Britishers!"
he cried, again and again; but the hail became
fainter as the boat drifted steadily away, first out of
the fading line of moonlight, and then on the face
of the sea, which darkened as the moon went down,
and the stars shone sharp and clear.
</p>

<p>
"A breeze is coming fast," said Captain Phillips,
cheerfully, as he took the wheel.  "Now,
gentlemen, our only real foremast-man is Noah, so we
must all become A.B.'s, and work together, and with
a will!  Dr. Heriot and Mr. Ashton, set those
head-sails; up with the jib and staysail; haul taut and
belay.  That will do.  Now set the driver; haul
out and sheet home; ease off those starboard tacks;
coil up and belay everything that is loose or adrift
on deck.  We have hard work before us, and our
lives yet depend upon how we perform it."
</p>

<p>
"Give me the wheel, Captain Phillips," said Tom
Bartelot.  "You have your whole ship to look
after."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Captain Bartelot."
</p>

<p>
"Our course&mdash;&mdash;" began the latter.
</p>

<p>
"Matters little to-night, or for the remainder of
the morning; only, not knowing our whereabouts,
we must keep a bright look-out.  To-morrow's
observations will let us know all."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, we're in latitudes now where Admiral
Fitzroy's storm-drums, cones, barometers,
jigamarees, and all them sort o' things ain't no use,"
said Noah; "it's Heaven's own blessed stars does
the business o' nights&mdash;here we read 'em as if they
were a pictur' book."
</p>

<p>
The wind came puff after puff, till the breeze
grew fine and steady.  The fore and main courses
soon filled and swelled out; the leach of each sail
formed a complete arc, and the once slack sheets
became taut, while the reef-points pattered as the
ship rose and fell on the rolling sea.
</p>

<p>
Once again the <i>Hermione</i> walked through the
waters, while the first rays of the coming sun began
to play along the edge of the horizon, and on the
clouds above, in tints of gold and crimson; and far
astern she left the drifting quarter-boat, with its
freight of yelling and raving wretches, to their fate,
perhaps their death, upon the sea.
</p>

<p>
By mid-day it could not be discerned, even with
the aid of the most powerful glass on board.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap10"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
PEDRO'S WOUND.
</h3>

<p>
All the few who could work on board the <i>Hermione</i>&mdash;seven
in number&mdash;to wit, Captain Phillips, and
his second mate, Mr. Foster, Morley Ashton, Tom
Bartelot, and his mate, Morrison, Doctor Heriot,
and Noah Gawthrop, now became foremast-men,
and had to work hard in putting the long-neglected
ship in some order.  Thus, they became riggers,
painters, ship-carpenters, and everything else in
turn.
</p>

<p>
Morley and the doctor were invaluable in the use
of the hammer and saw, and in plaiting sinnet of
rope or spunyarn, and in assisting to get better jury
spars rigged, spare sails bent, and new chafing
clapped on back and forestays, or wherever necessary.
</p>

<p>
The pumps were first attended to, and all the
debris flung into the cabin by the mutineers was
cleared out, the shot replaced round the coamings
of the hatchway, the hatchway itself reclosed, and
battened down; the buckets were hung again at the
break of the quarter-deck, ropes were coiled over
the belaying-pins, spare spars were lashed alongside,
and everything was tidied fore and aft, and made as
shipshape as the small number of workers and their
circumstances would permit; even the scuttle-butt
was lashed again to its ring-bolts on deck, and the
captain's spyglass and gutta-percha trumpet placed
on their brass cleats in the companion-way.
</p>

<p>
All the rubbish accumulated during the disorderly
reign of the mutineers was thrown overboard; the
head-pump was rigged, and the deck, after being
deluged with water, was cleanly swabbed up.  All
this unwonted work caused an unusual quantity of
pale ale to be consumed, together with more than
one case of Mr. Basset's still Cliquot and sparging
Moselle, which had escaped the investigations of
Pedro and his compatriots.
</p>

<p>
Noah was installed as cook, and Heriot had to
take his "trick" at the wheel with the rest&mdash;in fact,
no one could be excused anything.  All worked
with hearty good-will, and not without anxiety,
knowing that if a gale blew, or a sudden squall
came on, they would have to reduce the sails in
succession, and not at once, as the emergency of the
occasion might require.
</p>

<p>
By mid-day Rose Basset, with a shawl pinned
over her braided hair, and old Nance Folgate, in a
straw bonnet of wonderful fashion and size, sat
smiling and wondering at all this, under the awning
on the quarter-deck.
</p>

<p>
Even Ethel, pale, anxious, and tremulous,
ventured to leave the bedside of her father, who was
progressing favourably, and once more inhaled, for
a few minutes, the sea-breeze.  She found it
delightful after the close atmosphere of the cabin for
so many days; but she was rather startled to see
Morley out on the arm of the mainyard, astride
above the deep, with his shirt-sleeves rolled up, and
a hank of spun-yarn between his teeth, as he was
busy, in a most workmanlike way, about the
weather-earing of the mainsail.  After a time,
however, she ceased to feel either wonder or alarm at
Morley's feats of seamanship.
</p>

<p>
Again the life of the vessel, though so slenderly
manned, seemed to be resumed; once more the
log-line was hove from time to time; daily the meridian
was taken, half-hourly the bell was clanged, and the
log-book was kept regularly.  If less than
half-handed, the large ship was now considerably
under-rigged; yet the duty of watch and watch by night
and day became pretty severe.
</p>

<p>
All the weapons in the cabin, together with those
taken from the marooned crew, were cleaned by
Noah, and put in order, with ammunition made up
for them, as the savages along the seaboard of the
coast of Madagascar were not to be trifled with by
the crew of a half-manned ship; and the warning
the officer of the corvette gave, concerning the three
piratical boats, was remembered with some anxiety
from time to time as an alarming and dangerous
contingency.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Foster entered in the log a full narrative of
all the late events, for the information of the owners,
and of the civil authorities of the first British
port&mdash;Port Louis all devoutly hoped it would be&mdash;at
which they might arrive.
</p>

<p>
He inserted a list of the crew who were set adrift,
with all the cogent reasons therefor, and these
statements were duly attested by the signatures of
all on board.  Thereto even Rose's pretty hand
appended her signature, and Nance Folgate added
"her X mark."
</p>

<p>
In addition to his new duties as seaman, Leslie
Heriot had his two patients, and often Ethel, to
attend upon, as her health had suffered considerably
by the successive terrors her mind had undergone
of late.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Basset progressed, as we have said, favourably;
but so slowly that it was impossible to say
when he might be able to leave his bed, so terrible
was the shock his system had sustained; but Pedro
Barradas lived longer than the doctor had foretold,
and more than once had cooling drinks and possets
given him from Ethel's own hands.  Such men as
Pedro take a long time to die, and Ethel, gentle and
forgiving, had no fear of him now.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Heriot, on the night the ship was recaptured,
moved alike by that compassion in which his noble
profession is seldom deficient, and by the poor
wretch's repeated entreaties that he would dress his
wound&mdash;<i>por amor del Madre de Dios! por amor del
Maria Santissima!</i>&mdash;examined him carefully, and
found it necessary to amputate his right arm above
the elbow.
</p>

<p>
With great <i>sang froid</i>, Noah, who received the
limb, carried it on deck, and tossed it overboard to
leeward.
</p>

<p>
Heriot then gave Pedro a soothing draught, to
procure him sleep, and at length he slept, but with
the seal of death upon his features, for mortification
had set in.  When awake, he endured an excess of
remorse, and fear of his approaching end, which
nearly drove him mad.
</p>

<p>
"<i>A padre&mdash;a padre, por amor del Santo de los
Santos!</i>" was his constant and piercing cry, that,
according to the religion which he had professed in
youth, he might not die unconfessed and unabsolved;
and his cries of despair at times reached the ears of
Mr. Basset, in the after portion of the ship.
</p>

<p>
Ere this, an observation had been taken by both
Captain Phillips and Tom Bartelot, who was an
equally good navigator; and, on comparing their
notes and working, they found that Pedro had
steered so well by the stars at night in the course he
had intended to pursue, that the ship was far up
the Mozambique Channel, and was then about south
latitude 21.8 deg., which made all those who knew
anything of the locality deem it almost miraculous
that the vessel, which had been so ill watched, had
not been cast away in the night on the Europa Rocks,
or some other of those treacherous reefs and little
islands that stud all the channel, but more especially
along the western coast of Madagascar&mdash;the Great
Britain of Africa, as it has been named.
</p>

<p>
To put the ship about, and to beat to windward,
against the south-west monsoon, for nearly 400
miles, until he could double Cape St. Mary, the
most southern point of that long island, and then
haul up for St. Louis, in the Mauritius, was the
plan at once decided upon by Captain Phillips; and
the evening of the second day saw the crippled
<i>Hermione</i>, running close-hauled, under all the
fore-and-aft canvas he could set upon her, making a long
tack towards the coast of Africa, while a tropical
sun, that crimsoned sea and sky, sunk amidst clouds
of flame in the north-western corner of the horizon.
</p>

<p>
In one of these long tacks, they saw the Europa
Rocks, which looked like a long, low island, with
clouds of sea-birds wheeling over it in mid-air, like
gnats against the amber-tinted morning sky; but,
happily, as yet, they saw nothing of the three red
proas, which they heard the officer of the <i>Clyde</i>
mention, in conjunction with these rocky islets
which lie in the centre of the channel.
</p>

<p>
Noah, when cleaning out the forecastle bunks&mdash;in
more than one of which were traces of blood&mdash;found
some withered daisies.  These he brought to
Heriot, who gave them, with some complimentary
remark, to Ethel, and an exclamation of surprise
escaped him when he saw her kiss them, and, while
her eyes filled with tears, place them tenderly between
the leaves of her Bible; for they were those gathered
by her on that dear grave in Acton churchyard, and
torn from her breast on that night of terror by the
fierce hand of Pedro Barradas&mdash;that man, so long a
source of terror and aversion, now helpless and
gentle as a child in their hands.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
REMORSE.
</h3>

<p>
On the morning after the ship was recaptured, while
the <i>Hermione</i> was "going free," and running
steadily with her staysails set, Morley and Bartelot
visited the dying wretch in the forecastle bunks for
a few minutes.  His aspect was very striking.
</p>

<p>
His sharp features were very pale; the rich olive
tint they usually wore had fled, and a tawny green
replaced it; his lips were black, and, being parted,
showed the strong white teeth, clenched firmly by
an agony that was mental rather than bodily; his
eyes were closed, and his thick black hair was
knotted in elf-like knots about his forehead.
Under the squalid blankets the Mexican desperado
was breathing low and heavily.
</p>

<p>
Hearing them descend through the forescuttle, he
opened his eyes, and gave them a long and sullen
stare, expressive only of indifference, for he felt
that all ties and cares on earth were broken with
him now, for Heriot had not attempted to deceive,
but had told him that the hour of his departure was
approaching, that mortification had set in, that he
could not survive long.
</p>

<p>
Morley lifted to the sufferer's lips the drinking
cup of weak wine-and-water, the only drink they
could procure him on board.  Pedro moistened his
hard-baked mouth, and muttered something expressive
of gratitude.  He was very weak and quite
gentle now.
</p>

<p>
"How strangely things come to pass in this world,"
said Tom Bartelot, in a low voice.  "So this is a son
of the old hermit we buried in that lonely islet of
the South Sea."
</p>

<p>
"Strange, indeed.  We should speak to him about
that while he can understand us."
</p>

<p>
"Barradas," said Bartelot, "your name is Pedro
Barradas, I believe?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied Pedro, opening his large, black,
bloodshot eyes, and surveying the speaker inquiringly
and with a sad earnestness.
</p>

<p>
"A Mexican Spaniard?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, senores; or Spanish Mexican, which you
please," said he, sighing wearily.
</p>

<p>
"From Orizaba, in La Vera Cruz&mdash;Orizaba, near
the Rio Blanco?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied Pedro, while something of native
suspicion crept suddenly over his pale face.
</p>

<p>
"And your mother?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, my mother!" he exclaimed in an indescribable
voice, "what of her?"
</p>

<p>
"She was named Mariquita Escudero, a woman
of the Puebla de Perote?" said Morley.
</p>

<p>
A convulsive spasm passed over the features of
Pedro, and with an effort he replied, in a low voice:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mia madre ha muerto</i>" (My mother is dead).
</p>

<p>
"We know that she died in the Barranca Secca."
</p>

<p>
"And who are you who know all this?" asked
Pedro, rallying his energies; "or how came you to
know it?"
</p>

<p>
"Through him whom you killed," replied Morley.
</p>

<p>
"Cramply Hawkshaw?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
A gleam of malevolence flashed from Pedro's black
eyes; but remembering, perhaps, the cold hand that
was already on the pulses of his heart, he groaned,
muttered, and crossed himself.
</p>

<p>
"Your father&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Demonio! senores, speak not of my father."
</p>

<p>
"Why, Pedro?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I never knew him; but my mother, my
poor mother, who loved her boys so well, so tenderly,"
he faltered, in a broken voice, while writhing
in his bed.
</p>

<p>
"From Hawkshaw I learned the terrible story of
your mother's fate and the crime of your brother
Zuares, in the Barranca Secca," said Morley, who
looked with deep interest on the strange workings
of the mind exhibited by the expressive visage of
the dying ruffian, whose sole human weakness
seemed to be a strong love for the memory of his
mother.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Mia madre! mia madre!</i>" said the once strong
man, in a voice that became touching, while tears
welled up into his eyes, long, long unused to such a
moisture.  "Oh, senores, bad, vile, cruel, wicked as
you deem me, at this terrible hour, when well-nigh
under weigh for&mdash;for&mdash;<i>where?</i>&mdash;it may be hell!&mdash;when
I think of <i>her</i>&mdash;of the only human being who
ever loved me&mdash;my heart swells with the old pang
that was so keen, so very keen at first, on that awful
evening in the Barranca Secca, and my memory goes
back to the happier years beyond.  I feel myself
again a little boy and seem to hear her gentle voice
calling me&mdash;Pedrillo&mdash;<i>el muchacho Pedrillo</i>&mdash;the
same little boy who served at the altar of San Jago,
who waked up in the winter nights and wept for his
mother, and thought her dear, dear face the fondest,
the sweetest, and the fairest under heaven&mdash;yes,
fairer and kinder even than that of the blessed
Madonna which hung in San Jago de Chili.  <i>Mia
madre ha muerto!</i>" he repeated, some four or five
times, with incoherent fondness.
</p>

<p>
"And your father?" resumed Bartelot, after a
pause, for they could not but respect this grief.
</p>

<p>
"I tell you, senores, I never knew my father,"
said Pedro, almost with a frown.
</p>

<p>
"Why?"
</p>

<p>
"He was Don Pedro Zuares de Barradas, a Spanish
cavalier of high family, possessing great estates on
the table land of Anahuac, and who was captain of
the castle of San Juan de Ulloa, for the Government
of the Free United States of South America.  He is
said to have perished at sea, by falling overboard in
a gale when being conveyed to Spain to be tried and
executed as a traitor to the king."
</p>

<p>
"All that we know; but he did not perish as you
suppose," said Morley.
</p>

<p>
"How, senor, how then?" asked Pedro, looking
up with surprise.
</p>

<p>
"He escaped drowning and became a hermit on
an island near Tristan d'Acunha."
</p>

<p>
"My father&mdash;a hermit!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"And this is truth?"
</p>

<p>
"Truth as we live and now address you," said
Bartelot; "what could we gain by any fabrication?"
</p>

<p>
"And&mdash;and he died&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"After a long life of devotion and repentance."
</p>

<p>
"Oh that his life and death may atone for mine
and for Zuares!  But how know you all this,
senores?"
</p>

<p>
"By a strange chance&mdash;a singular coincidence&mdash;Pedro
Barradas," said Morley.
</p>

<p>
"Bad as I am, fallen though I be, you would not,
I am assured, trifle with the agonies of a dying
wretch," said Pedro, in a low, moaning voice.
</p>

<p>
"No," replied Tom Bartelot, gravely; "neither
of us are capable of doing so."
</p>

<p>
"But tell me how you came by the knowledge of
these things?'
</p>

<p>
"Landing on that solitary isle by chance, we
found an old recluse at the point of death, and
discovered his name by means of a written confession
which he left behind him."
</p>

<p>
"And&mdash;and this confession, senores," said Pedro,
raising himself on his elbow, and looking at Morley
and Bartelot alternately, as if he would read their
very souls; "this confession&mdash;where is it?"
</p>

<p>
"It was written on the blank leaves of a Spanish
missal, and was lost when my ship foundered at sea.
By that confession, however, we learned his name
and history, and also that he was a knight of the
Military Order of Santiago de Compostella," added
Tom Bartelot, as Morley drew from his pocket-book
the red enamelled cross of that famous old Spanish
confraternity, and gave it to Pedro, who pressed it
to his lips again and again with his only remaining
hand.
</p>

<p>
"I feel now, senores, that you speak truth," said,
he, while the tears that flowed down his cheek
relieved his emotion, and cleared his utterance.
"When I am dead, senores, you will bury this cross
with me.  And he died in your hands?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; and we buried him near his hut, setting
up a little wooden cross to mark his grave."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ave Madre de Dios!</i> no cross will ever mark
mine; no prayer, or blessing, can accompany the
departure of me!" groaned Pedro, in a low voice,
as if communing with himself.
</p>

<p>
"From that written confession, taken in connection
with the revelations of Hawkshaw" (at this
name something of the old devilish gleam passed
over Pedro's features) "we recognised both you and
your brother; and we learned that your mother,
Mariquita Escudero, had marked each of you, in
infancy, with a cross on the left shoulder."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, senor&mdash;dyed, tattooed redly on the skin,
with the juice of a plant that grows on the warm
slopes of the volcano at Orizaba.  See," added
Pedro, as he drew back his blue shirt, and displayed
his brawny shoulder, on which there was distinctly
traced a cross like that of St. James.  "Our poor
mother punctured that mark on each of her little
boys, in the hope that Santiago would take us under
his protection; but, alas! from infancy we were
the peculiar care of the infernal spirit."
</p>

<p>
With all the impulsiveness of his race, Pedro
behaved at times in a very frantic manner, and
these paroxysms induced a subsequent weakness
and lethargy, that seemed the precursor of
dissolution; but he was a man of a powerful frame, and
the instinct of life was strong within him.  He
expressed great satisfaction, almost joy, to learn that
Mr. Basset had survived the outrage contemplated
by him and the mutineers; and thus, that, thanks
to Dr. Heriot's skill, he had one sin less to atone for.
</p>

<p>
Then he entreated that Ethel would come, that
he might implore her pardon.  This the poor
creature sought in terms so touching that Ethel was
deeply moved, and ventured to speak with him in
terms of consolation.
</p>

<p>
But there was ever the same reply from Pedro&mdash;there
was no priest on board, and he was beyond
being consoled.  So Ethel proved his only soother,
and read to him at times from the Bible&mdash;her
mother's Bible&mdash;the same that had fallen from her
unconscious hand on the night when Pedro so
daringly carried her off; and a striking little group
they formed&mdash;the black-haired and black-bearded
Spanish ruffian, his tawny visage, already pale and
pinched by the touch of death, pressing to his lips
the red cross of Santiago again and again, while
striving to follow her words and understand them,
as they fell softly and distinctly from the lips of
that fair-skinned and delicate English girl, who sat
by the side of his bed, in the squalid and noisome
forecastle, with the half dim daylight struggling
through the square scuttle above, and, perhaps,
Morley, with his loving smile, or Tom Bartelot, with
his sun-burned face, listening near.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, in Pedro's paroxysms, his voice rose
almost to a shriek.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! senora," he would exclaim to poor shrinking
Ethel, "pray for me&mdash;pray for me.  You are
good&mdash;you are kind&mdash;you are pure&mdash;while I&mdash;I&mdash;what
am I?  Heaven will hear you when Heaven
will not hear me!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, do not speak thus," implored Ethel.
</p>

<p>
"I must, senora&mdash;I dare not pray for myself.  To
me the ear of God will be deaf, or turn from me."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Pedro, why?"
</p>

<p>
"I have been so wicked, so bad!  I have
committed many sins, and <i>one most awful deed</i>, for
which I cannot hope for pardon from Him whom I
outraged, and whose altar I desecrated&mdash;never, oh
never!"
</p>

<p>
His voice died away in low moans; but Pedro
seemed no longer the same piratical ruffian, for,
when speaking, his voice, manner, and diction were
all changed and improved.
</p>

<p>
This scene, with his mental suffering and terror
of death, proved all too much for Ethel's nervous
system, and Morley wished to remove her; but
Pedro implored her to remain with him yet a little
while, and even caught her skirt as she rose to
withdraw.
</p>

<p>
"Great though your sins may be, my poor man,
be assured that the mercy of God is greater still,"
said Ethel, weeping.  "Like the sea we traverse, it
is boundless."
</p>

<p>
"But so may be God's vengeance, and I have
shed blood&mdash;the blood of many," he replied in a
low, concentrated voice, through his clenched
teeth.
</p>

<p>
Ethel grew very, very pale on hearing this, and
drew back again, lest he might clutch her dress
once more.
</p>

<p>
"Well, even those whose blood you shed may be
praying for you, if&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What&mdash;what?" asked Pedro, huskily.
</p>

<p>
"If you sincerely repent."
</p>

<p>
"I do repent&mdash;I do repent, and sincerely too," he
said, impetuously; "but without a priest to absolve
me&mdash;to give me the last sacraments of that church
in whose belief my mother reared me&mdash;what matters
my repentance?"
</p>

<p>
Then he howled and gnashed his strong white
teeth, while tearing his black glossy hair with his
only remaining hand.
</p>

<p>
"Let hope for the future find a place in your
heart, Pedro, and grow there with repentance for the
past," urged Ethel, while shrinking close to Morley,
for the appearance of the patient terrified her.
</p>

<p>
"And then, senora, you say nothing of penance?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I know nothing of it," replied Ethel.
</p>

<p>
"A priest! a priest!  Oh, that the sea would
give up its dead, for I know there is one, at least
there; but could I face <i>him</i>?" he added, wildly;
"oh! that night of horrors at Santiago&mdash;I see the
flames yet, and feel them in my soul!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Pedro Barradas," said Ethel, as this
paroxysm induced weakness, and nothing was heard
but his deep and heavy breathing; "whatever be
the sins you have committed, remember that this
book tells us 'there is more joy in heaven over one
sinner who truly repents than over ninety-nine just
men who do it not.'"
</p>

<p>
"Hear her, O Lord, who created heaven and
earth, who divided light from darkness, and the sea
from the land!" prayed the poor wretch, while
crossing himself again and again, with his left hand,
"and who formed me out of dust, to which I shall
never return, because I must be buried in the sea,"
he added with something of simplicity; then, as his
mind seemed to wander, he said, "<i>Mi madre</i>, listen
to me, am I praying aright?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, Pedro, you pray aright," replied Ethel,
covering her face with her handkerchief, and taking
Morley's arm, "lead me away, dearest," she
whispered, "I must return to papa.  Pray on,
Pedro, it is proper, it is good for you."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Ave Maria purissima!</i>" he said, "my own
mother is at your feet interceding for me.  Oh, she
loved her little Pedrillo so well&mdash;and Zuares
too&mdash;could she have foreseen this end!"
</p>

<p>
His voice completely failed him now, and Morley
led Ethel on deck.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap12"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
STORY OF A MODERN SPANISH ROGUE.
</h3>

<p>
"The remorse of that unfortunate wretch has in it
something appalling," said Morley, as they walked aft.
</p>

<p>
"Bah!" replied Captain Phillips, who was busy
with his quadrant; "I have seen something of this
kind before, Mr. Ashton, and know it is only a case
of 'the devil was sick:' you know the rest of the
couplet."
</p>

<p>
"What crimes can he have committed?" said
Ethel, who was weeping with sympathy.
</p>

<p>
"Crimes, Miss Basset!" repeated the captain, as
he wiped and adjusted the two speculums or horizon
glasses; "Lord love your kind heart, he'll have
committed every crime that ever was recorded in
Newgate, and would commit 'em all again, but old
King Death has brought him up with a round turn."
</p>

<p>
Whether it was the result of Ethel's visit, or that
excess of despair had prostrated his nerves, we
know not; but as night approached Pedro became
more composed, and was heard to pray very
fervently.  The iron had entered his soul; he wept
freely, and his tears relieved him; but the retrospect
of his past life still rose like a barrier of flame
before him, and this he said from time to time, when
Morley Ashton and Tom Bartelot watched him by
turns, or together, and gave him drink; for he was
tormented by a consuming fever and thirst.
</p>

<p>
The night was fine and clear, the constellations
that look down on the mighty Indian Ocean were
shining amid the pure ether overhead, and the waves
sparkled in light as they rolled around the fleet
<i>Hermione</i>, for she was still running steadily,
close-hauled, making a long tack towards the distant
coast of Africa.
</p>

<p>
Morley had bade "Good night" to Ethel, and he
and Tom Bartelot sat smoking on the steps of the
forecastle, when they could equally attend to the
wants of Pedro, and bear a hand with what was
wanted on deck.
</p>

<p>
As if to relieve his mind, between his muttered
orisons, Pedro mentioned many dark episodes of his
career, among slavers in the West Indies, and
otter-hunters in the Pacific Ocean; among the
gold-diggers of California, and the robbers of the
Barranca Secca, between Zalappa and the Puebla
de Perote.  The names of Hawkshaw and Zuares
occurred more than once in these wild stories,
which, with his casual remarks, indicated Pedro's
complicity in many heinous crimes, and filled his
listeners with wonder and repugnance; but there
was one story he related, with many pauses, filled
with sighs and outbursts of repentance, which
showed that he was more an incarnate fiend than a
mere common villain or everyday rogue.
</p>

<p>
To rehearse it here, as he related it&mdash;he who
seemed to be in a Hades without hope&mdash;would prove
scarcely intelligible to the reader; so we shall give
this episode of Pedro's past life in our own words,
with many additions, the result of local inquiry.
These are woven up with the text of the story, as
being preferable to giving them in the tantalising
form of notes.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
In their childhood Pedro and Zuares Barradas in
no way promised to become the outcasts of religion
and of nature they proved in future years.
</p>

<p>
Aware of her own errors and frailty, for which she
repented in bitterness, in sackcloth and ashes, in
hours of sorrow, prayer, and self-inflicted penance,
known to Heaven and herself only, Mariquita
Escudero lived for her sons alone.  Had she been
without them to cling to, in the rash impulsiveness
of her race and of her nature, she would probably
have committed suicide, after the sudden death of
her father, the catastrophe which happened to her
young brother, Juan, on the ramparts of San Juan
de Ulloa, and the loss of her lover, Don Pedro, who
was borne away beyond the sea.
</p>

<p>
She educated her boys carefully and lovingly,
living with them the life of a recluse at her father's
solitary <i>granja</i>, on the slope of the Pico d'Orizaba,
and striving to impress them with a high sense of
religion and morality, and thought that she had
done so completely, all unaware, poor woman, of the
latent and inherent spark of the infernal spirit that
slumbered in the heart of each.
</p>

<p>
Her whole hopes for the future, her entire soul,
were centred in her little boys, and this tender and
repentant mother was never weary of watching
them when they assisted at the service of mass, in
carrying tapers or little vessels of holy-water, and
when making responses, in attending the old Bishop
of Orizaba within the rails of the great altar.
</p>

<p>
Neither was she ever weary of sewing and
dressing with her own hands the little white
surplices which they wore over their black soutans
on those occasions, for she knew that her boys were
handsome, and were alike the envy and the taunt of
other mothers.
</p>

<p>
Pedro and Zuares spent nearly their whole time
in or about the old cathedral church&mdash;a fane, the
pride of the wooded valley, and founded of old by
a pious follower of Hernan Cortez.  They sat or
played for hours daily on the steps of that great
altar, where Pedro Valdivia prayed in his armour,
ere he marched against the Aurucans of Chili.
</p>

<p>
Thereon stood a beautiful image of Our Lady,
holding in her arms her divine Son, with arms
outspread, a miracle of sculpture and painting.  She
was clad in an azure robe, with an aureole and
thirteen stars above her brow, all sparkling with
precious gems.
</p>

<p>
Frequently Zuares used to talk to these figures as
if they were answering him; while hovering in the
side-aisles, with a finger on her lips, tears in her
eyes, and hope and gladness in her heart, Mariquita
watched and listened, assured that they would
become faithful servants of God, and as such would
atone for the errors of her own life, and again and
again she blessed her little boys, and whispered in
her mother's heart, "that of such was the kingdom
of heaven."
</p>

<p>
Pedro at times spoke to the image of the little
child Jesus, as if it was a playfellow; while, like the
little chorister of the old legend of Chartres, Zuares
was wont to say that he had divided his heart into
three portions: "one he had given to God, one to
the Blessed Virgin, and one to his mother."  Yet,
as years crept on, it seemed as if all the snares of
Satan had been set around to tempt and lure them,
for they rapidly fell into evil ways; they abandoned
the church, the morning mass and evening vespers,
with all their duties and services; they became the
companions of outlaws and robbers, and it was by
the hand of her youngest and best-beloved son that
the unfortunate Mariquita, long since broken in
heart and crushed in soul, perished, as we have
shown, in the savage gorge of the Barranca Secca.
</p>

<p>
Even the old bishop wept as he cursed them.
</p>

<p>
Zuares had early joined a band of outlaws in the
Barranca, where, among many other outrages, on a
dark night, when there was no other light on earth
or in heaven, save the flaming cone of Orizaba,
which lit up all the grove of peach trees that clothe
the valley, they waylaid and robbed a wealthy
<i>escribano</i>, or lawyer, of the city.  Then with a
refinement of cruelty, they tied him across the nearest
line of railway, and watched to see him torn to
shreds by the first train which passed; but his cries
of despair&mdash;which they mimicked and mocked&mdash;reached
the ears of the engine-driver, the train was
stopped in time, and the escribano saved.  He never
forgot the horrors of that night, and became an
honest man for ever after, abandoning for ever the
study and practice of the law.
</p>

<p>
He denounced Zuares, however, and the reward
for his capture, offered by the alcalde, proving too
great for the cupidity of his companions, this
enterprising youth, ere long, found himself a captive in
the <i>carcel</i> or prison of Orizaba, under sentence to
die by the garotte.
</p>

<p>
The day of his execution had been named, when
letters to the bishop and alcalde arrived, threatening
vengeance, and to the dismay of the people, the
famous image of Our Lady was missed from the
altar of the cathedral church, having been carried
off, with its golden aureole, the precious gems that
decked it, and the thirteen stars that sparkled
round her brow.
</p>

<p>
In its place was found a piece of paper, on which
was written:
</p>

<p class="letter">
"A hostage for my brother.
</p>

<p class="letter">
"PEDRO BARRADAS."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
From the altar, the old bishop, in full pontificals,
denounced vengeance on the sacrilegious robber,
and threatened with condign punishment here and
hereafter all who were concerned in this new outrage,
which filled all the good people of Orizaba with
grief and indignation, for the image of Our Lady
was the peculiar palladium of their city.
</p>

<p>
On the following day, this notice was found
appended to the cathedral door:
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="letter">
"I, Pedro Barradas, know who stole the image of Our Lady
from the great altar; I know also in what part of the Barranca Secca
it is concealed.  To the altar I shall restore it, but on two
conditions; first, the instant release of my brother Zuares, who is
condemned to die for mulcting a miserable escribano of a few
ill-gotten dollars; second, a pardon for myself; otherwise, the Holy
Image shall never more be seen."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Great was the indignation of the entire community
at this insolence; but discretion was deemed
better than severity.  Zuares was set at liberty by
the alcalde, who placed round the cathedral a guard
of soldiers, with orders to shoot down any <i>bandido</i>
who should appear, even if he bore the image of Our
Lady.
</p>

<p>
How the act was achieved will never be known;
but in the night after the release of Zuares, the
image was replaced on the altar, unseen by the
guard and other watchers.  Some there were who
said the soldiers were tipsy or asleep; others
stigmatised the whole affair as a trick of the Jesuits, of
course.  But by far the greater number declared it
was a miracle, and Orizaba poured her thousands
towards the cathedral gates, shouting:
</p>

<p>
"<i>La Madonna neustra!  La Madonna del
Paradiso</i>!  A miracle!  a miracle!"
</p>

<p>
The old bishop, however, did not share this
enthusiasm; neither did he think there was any
miracle in the matter: for the holy image had come
back denuded of its golden aureole and its thirteen
stars, each of which was composed of thirteen
magnificent rose diamonds.
</p>

<p>
After this, the wooded valley of Orizaba, even the
recesses of the Barranca Secca, became too hot to
hold these wicked brothers; they fled to the sea
and took a passage for San Francisco, where, after
many wanderings in the lawless land of the
gold-diggers, they found their way to Vera Cruz, and
lived among some outlaws and <i>contrabandists</i> in their
old haunt, the Barranca.
</p>

<p>
In the summer of last year, immediately after the
terrible episode of Zuares and his mother in that
wild place, Pedro and he quitted the valley of Orizaba
for the third time, and reaching the port of La Vera
Cruz, shipped as foremast-men on board a long, low,
sharp, and rakish-looking brigantine, bound, as her
captain stated vaguely, "for the Pacific, towards the
Bay of Mexilones."
</p>

<p>
She proved to be an otter-hunter, and long ere
she doubled Cape Horn, she had her eight brass
guns, which had been concealed in the hold, hoisted
out and lashed to the ports, the wooden quakers
they replaced being sent below; and then sundry
pikes, cutlasses, and pistols, that had all been
invisible while the brigantine was within range of the
cannon of San Juan de Ulloa, were placed upon
racks in the steerage, and presented a goodly array;
for these otter-hunting craft are lawless and
contraband, and frequently their crews must fight their
way against Spanish and other war ships, like the
buccaneers of old.
</p>

<p>
She ran along the coast of South America, in
sight of the snow-capped summits of the mighty
Andes, traversing a great portion of the Pacific,
without accident or adventure, until, in a forecastle
row, knives were drawn, and Zuares threatened to
stab the mate.  In such a craft severe measures
were necessary, so Zuares was put in the bilboes,
and would have been scourged next day, by order
of the captain, save for an accident which happened
to the latter in the night.
</p>

<p>
Taking advantage of an intense darkness about
the first hour of the morning watch, the worthy
brothers quitted the brigantine, dropping quietly
astern of her in the quarter-boat, when the harbour
lights of Valparaiso were visible about three leagues
distant on the lee bow, as they had resolved never
again to face the snows and horrors of doubling the
Horn, and reefing topsails that were stiff with
ice.
</p>

<p>
They did not quit the brigantine, however,
without leaving tokens of their vengeance.  The poor
captain was found in his berth, with the
sheath-knife of Zuares&mdash;that illegal weapon now so
constantly in use among seamen&mdash;planted in his heart;
and it was soon after discovered that a canvas bag,
containing two thousand Mexican dollars, was gone,
as well as the quarter-boat.
</p>

<p>
But long ere this was known on board the armed
brigantine, her two deserters had pulled the boat
into the harbour of Valparaiso, where they scuttled
her, and landed at the Almendral, a suburb which
lies close by the shore, and is chiefly inhabited by
those who are employed about the shipping.
</p>

<p>
Here they divided the contents of the bag between
them, and the precious pair having shaken hands,
they separated, each to shift for himself.
</p>

<p>
Master of a thousand silver dollars, and of
himself&mdash;rid of his brother Zuares, whose petulant and
fiery temper was frequently the means of embroiling
him in useless, or what he deemed still worse,
unprofitable quarrels&mdash;Pedro hoped to enjoy himself
in Chili, and without fear, too, as the mates and
crew of the otter-hunter (of whom our late American
acquaintance, Mr. Bill Badger, formed one), were
already too far beyond the pale of all laws, even
those of South America, to seek either him or
Zuares, especially under the Cordilleras de los
Andes.
</p>

<p>
He resolved to get rid of his sailor's costume; to
dress himself like an emigrant hidalgo; to take
upon himself the airs, and certainly all the ease of
one, until his money was spent, and something else
turned up.  He was not without hope, too, of
replenishing his stock at the Casa de Juego, or
gaming-house (as we have related he was never
without a pair of cogged <i>dados</i>), and he knew, from
his previous habits and education, that he could act
tolerably well the part he meant to assume; and
who could say that he might not, if a run of fortune
favoured him, marry an heiress, and settle down
pleasantly till the money was spent.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Come esta el Senor Caballero Don Pedro,</i>" said
he, as he lit a cigarito, and slapped the bag
containing his dollars with great gusto; "courage,
and to work at once, for the day will soon
dawn."
</p>

<p>
He quitted the Almendral, with its muddy streets
and unpaved narrow lanes, and just as the sun was
rising, or, rather, as its light was descending on the
steep red cliffs, and penetrating into the deep dark
mountain gullies that overhang the city of
Valparaiso&mdash;or the Valley of Paradise&mdash;he found himself
amid the opening shops and early morning bustle
of the spacious Plaza de la Victoria.
</p>

<p>
He soon found the shop of a clothier (all
shopkeepers in Valparaiso are Frenchmen), under whose
auspices he substituted his forecastle attire for a
round jacket of fine claret colour, braided elaborately
with yellow and scarlet silk, especially about
the breast, and slit-up sleeves, loose, braided trousers
of some light material, girt at the waist by a Spanish
sash of the Chilian colours.  His sou'-wester gave
place to a smart sombrero of black velvet, with a
plush bob of the same sable hue on one side, and a
long scarlet riband flowing on the other; and in
lieu of the dingy checked shirt, which was washed
once weekly, and strung on the mainstay to dry,
he exhibited one of spotless linen, with elaborate
needlework on the breast.
</p>

<p>
A poncho cloak, black without and scarlet within,
was thrown over the left shoulder, for use by night,
for ornament by day, and to conceal the bowie-knife
and revolver, which completed his equipment.
</p>

<p>
After a barber had shaved off his luxuriant beard
and whiskers, leaving only the heavy, black, and
well-trimmed moustache, Pedro walked along the
shady side of the Plaza de la Victoria, surveying his
outward mien, in the plate-glass windows as he
passed them, a long regalia between his lips, master
still of 930 dollars, and perfectly satisfied with
himself, and with the South American world in
general.
</p>

<p>
In the shop of the barber he had filled up a spare
moment, by fitting on, and pocketing unseen, a
luxuriant red wig, which he thought might at some
time prove useful to him; and aware that a
traveller without baggage has always short credit and
a shady reputation, he next procured a handsome
trunk of ample dimensions, with screws to fix it to
the floor of any place which he might happen to
honour with his residence&mdash;a very old "dodge,"
indeed, or, as the Spaniards would call it,
<i>tergiversation</i>.
</p>

<p>
Repairing to the Posa de San Augustin, still kept
by a person named Felipe Fernandez, close by the
Church of the Augustin Friars, he chose an
apartment, from the lattice of which he could have a
view of the volcano of Aconcagua, sending a
tremendous column of smoke up to the very zenith,
through a sky of wonderful purity, against the blue
of which the snow-capped Andes stood in a clear
and awful outline; and this selection impressed
Signor Fernandez that his guest was a wealthy
hidalgo in search of the picturesque.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Basta!</i>" said Pedro, as he tore a roasted galina
to pieces at dinner, and devoured it with more
rapidity than grace, "I have eaten nothing for two
days; but this is excellent, and the wine, too&mdash;your
health, brother Zuares."
</p>

<p>
At this posada Pedro resided for several days,
and ran up a goodly bill, chiefly for stronger liquors
than are usually drunk by noble hidalgos; but his
trunk being securely screwed to the floor, so as to
be quite immovable, Felipe Fernandez was quite
easy on the subject, believing that a guest with a
box so ponderous&mdash;full of duros, no doubt&mdash;could
not levant in a hurry.
</p>

<p>
Pedro's tastes and instincts would have led him
towards the alleys of the Almendral, the harbour,
and the shipping; but he remembered the little
accident which occurred on the last night he and
Zuares spent on board the brigantine, so he wisely
avoided the vicinity of the sea-shore, and turned
his thoughts inland.
</p>

<p>
He actually gave himself airs of propriety, and
inquired of Signor Fernandez which was the most
attractive church in Valparaiso.  Pedro meant
attractive in the number of fair devotees; but Felipe
understood him differently and replied:
</p>

<p>
"The Matriz Church, senor.  The Padres Eizagiuerro
and Ugarte, from Santiago, are preaching
there now.  The former is the Apostolic Nuncio,
and friend of His Holiness the Pope."
</p>

<p>
"And their preaching draws the people in numbers?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, senor," replied the host, bowing lower.
</p>

<p>
"I am particularly fond of a good sermon, and
love to see a well-filled church."
</p>

<p>
"Why, senor, the people go for various reasons,"
continued Fernandez, smiling; "the women to
show themselves."
</p>

<p>
"And the men&mdash;what do they go for?"
</p>

<p>
"To see the women, or put off time till the
theatre opens."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Bueno</i>!  I shall go to see the women, and hear
the Padre&mdash;what the devil's his name?"
</p>

<p>
So Pedro hung a brass medal of the Madonna at
his neck, bought a rosary as thick as a hawser, and
went to the Matriz Church to vespers, and always
fell asleep.  Mass was too early for him, he was
always a-bed then.  As all the women were very old
or very ugly, he soon grew tired of the eloquence
of the Padres Ugarte and Eizagiuerro.
</p>

<p>
The latter was the most popular; the church was
usually filled by a dense crowd, who stood, as there
was no sitting space, and through whom Pedro's
brawny arms and square shoulders forced a passage,
without ceremony, right and left, straight up to the
pulpit, in spite of crinoline or other obstructions,
and reiterated exclamations of annoyance.
</p>

<p>
"Senor, the church is quite full!"
</p>

<p>
"So I see, senora.  A charming place, isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
"Senor, you <i>cannot</i> pass further!" exclaimed
someone else.
</p>

<p>
"I shall try," was the cool response.
</p>

<p>
"Senor, how can you be so troublesome?"
exclaimed a young man angrily.
</p>

<p>
Pedro turned to him with a dark scowl.
</p>

<p>
A young lady, closely veiled, was hanging on his
arm.
</p>

<p>
"Perez&mdash;dear Perez!" said she, entreatingly,
and, with a voice of great sweetness, added, "Senor,
do not crush me so, if you please."
</p>

<p>
"Do I incommode you, senora?" stammered
Pedro.
</p>

<p>
"Very much indeed."
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me&mdash;I shall make room."
</p>

<p>
And he did so by lurching forward and squeezing
an old duenna against a pillar, where she was nearly
suffocated by his huge back, and from whence he
began to eye&mdash;almost ogle&mdash;the young lady who
had spoken.
</p>

<p>
Her features, though partially hidden by a black
lace veil, were charming and soft, and the pressure
of the crowd had deranged it so far as to permit
Pedro's bold and wandering eye to see enough of
an adorable white neck and swelling bust to make
him long to look on more.
</p>

<p>
Her nostrils and lips in contour were singularly
fine, her tresses were of a rich ripply brown, and a
valuable rosary was in her pretty hands, which were
cased in well-fitting gloves of lavender-coloured kid.
</p>

<p>
Pedro was smitten.  He continued to ogle and
leer, and make a cushion of the old lady behind, in
a mode of which the young girl was all unconscious,
for she never looked at him once, though her male
companion, whom she had named Perez, felt
undisguised anger and uneasiness from time to time.
</p>

<p>
Of his frowns Pedro saw nothing, for his attention
was riveted on the sweet young girl, so nothing
heard he of the Reverend Padre Eizagiuerro's
denunciations of worldly sin and iniquity.
</p>

<p>
The sermon over, and benediction given, Pedro
rushed to the font, that he might give her some
holy water in the hollow of his hand; but Perez, by
an awkward or intended motion, knocked it into the
eyes of Pedro, who was half blinded by its saline
property.  He uttered a malediction, and resolved
to follow the little beauty; but she was driven away
in a handsome carriage.
</p>

<p>
Again and again he came to vespers; but the
sweet girl was no longer there to mingle her soft
voice with the hymn; and, as we have said, the
other fair ones who attended the Matriz Church
were not to our adventurer's taste, he contented
himself by leering at all the girls who promenaded
in the Plaza, and this he did so pointedly, that, in
one or two instances, nothing saved him from being
punished summarily, even in that city of poniards
and police, but his towering figure, muscular limbs,
and dare-devil aspect.
</p>

<p>
A fortnight slipped away without any adventure.
</p>

<p>
He had not yet fallen on an heiress, and already
400 of his beloved dollars had slipped away, but
not in works of charity or devotion.  Money is
easier spent than won everywhere, so Pedro began
to get tired of Valparaiso.
</p>

<p>
He certainly led a very jolly life.  There were no
watches to keep in the wind and rain; no hoarse
voice at the fore-scuttle summoned all hands to reef
topsails on a sleety night; no scrambling for the
best of the beef and potatoes in the filthy mess kid;
no weevils to pick out of the mouldy biscuits; no
pumps to work at, or decks to scrub; but withal
Pedro&mdash;he knew not why&mdash;began to be weary, and
wonder what Zuares was about: whether his share
of the spoil was spent, and where he had turned his
steps.
</p>

<p>
In Valparaiso, the mercantile men are nearly all
Britons, Americans, or Germans.  Thus, in the <i>cafés</i>
frequented by Pedro, his appearance and bearing
did not suit their taste exactly, and he never got
beyond receiving and giving a very cold bow,
exchanging a light for his cigar, or a civil remark now
and then.
</p>

<p>
If he had the fumes of wine in his head&mdash;an
element it was seldom without&mdash;he rattled out a
forecastle oath in Spanish or English, which made
them stare at him, and then at each other.  Though
twice at the Casa de Juego he had more than
replenished his exchequer so rapidly that suspicion of
foul play was excited, on one evening fortune was
so decidedly against him that he walked forth into
the Plaza with only ten dollars in his pocket, and
the prospect of receiving his bill at the posada,
amounting to 400 at least, which had been overdue
now more than a week.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Los Infernos!</i>" thought he; "what is to be done
now?"
</p>

<p>
The idea of donning his red wig, taking a turn
through the streets after dark, and relieving some
belated citizen of his purse, occurred to him; but he
reflected on the acumen of the well-regulated police,
and, with a malediction on things in general, wished
himself at San Francisco, or La Villa Rica del Vera
Cruz.
</p>

<p>
The evening was singularly beautiful; so much
so that even Pedro could not be insensible to its
lovely calm, and to the wonderful rocky scenery
that overhangs the Valley of Paradise, as he
rambled listlessly along the harbour towards the
fort, on which the flag of the Chilian Republic was
waving.
</p>

<p>
The stupendous hills that overlook the city were
steeped in golden light, which streamed into the
ravines that yawned beneath them; and each of
these ravines seemed to be piled up on both sides
with white-walled houses&mdash;for every chasm formed
as it were a street, that branched upward from the
low-lying suburb, named the Almendral.
</p>

<p>
The spires, the bay with its shipping, the cannon
on the batteries, were all burnished with the yellow
sheen, and over all, towering blue and dim in the
distance, rose the cone of Aconcagua, sending a
cloud of sombre smoke on the south wind, far away
towards the woody and snowy Andes, whose summits
rise above the limits of eternal frost&mdash;for the
burning mountain we have named is 23,000 feet
above the level of the sea at Valparaiso; and there
are thirteen similar peaks in Chili, all nearly in a
constant state of eruption, flame, smoke, and lava.
</p>

<p>
The lattices of a thousand villas that nestled on
the sloping hills were gleaming in the light of the
setting sun, as he sunk into the waters of the Pacific,
casting the shadows of their walls and terraced roofs
on gardens, where the gorgeous, but scentless,
flowers of the tropics were closing their petals, and
where the deep green leaves of the guava contrasted
with the purple tints of the olive, the golden bulbs
of the orange, and the giant quinces of Chili, that
were ripening in his warmth&mdash;the glow of a summer
that never ceases.
</p>

<p>
Pedro surveyed all this with a half-listless,
half-pleased eye; and he watched the groups of idlers,
in their picturesque dresses of gaudy colours, who
thronged the harbour mole and evening promenade.
There were the graceful Spanish whites, particularly
the donzellas, with their sparkling eyes and piquante
smiles, their black lace mantillas, short crinolines,
and taper ankles; the slenderly-formed and olive-skinned
mestizoes, and the half-naked, supple, and
grinning mulattoes, who sung so gaily as they
worked in gangs at cranes or capstan-bars.
</p>

<p>
Several padres were among the promenaders,
chiefly Grey Friars, in greasy frocks and hoods, with
beads and cord complete; and Chilian soldiers were
not wanting, in tawdry uniforms, with plenty of
braid without, and plenty of fleas within.
</p>

<p>
Two priests passed him&mdash;they were tall, thin, and
sallow men&mdash;for whom all made way, for they were
the famous preachers from Santiago, the Padres
Ugarte and Eizagiuerro; and when Pedro lifted
his sombrero, a pang shot through his heart as he
thought of Zuares, and their boyish days, when they
carried tapers, or swung the censer before the old
Bishop of Orizaba&mdash;of what they were, and what
they might have been.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Caramba!</i>" he muttered, "why should I think
of such things?"
</p>

<p>
The harbour was full of shipping from Lima and
Peru, taking in Cordovan leather in brown bales,
cordage in vast coils, and dried fruit in boxes of all
sizes.  The waves curled in golden prisms over the
great rock that lies near the shore, and the
yellow-billed and speckled seamews that always cluster
there fled screaming towards the offing, as the flag
was hauled down and the evening gun boomed
across the water from the fort which the Spaniards
built of old as a defence against the Indians.
</p>

<p>
The evening was calm and mild, and the hum of
the city was carried away by the soft breeze that
swept across the bay, where hundreds of pleasure-boats
were shooting to and fro under sail or oar.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a gaudy little pinnace, that was running
for the stairs near the old half-moon battery, caught
the nautical eye of Pedro.
</p>

<p>
"Luff, luff, presto!" he exclaimed, as he saw
there was something foul with the sheet; "luff, you
lubber!"
</p>

<p>
The words had scarcely left his lips ere there was
a shout from the spectators.  The shoulder-of-mutton
sail shivered and flapped as the boat
broached-to and capsized.
</p>

<p>
Then a lady and gentleman were seen floundering
and splashing in the water.  The latter succeeded
in reaching the keel of the inverted boat, to which
he clung, wildly shouting for help the while; but
the former was swept by the current that ran round
the harbour rock.
</p>

<p>
"My daughter!  <i>O Dios mio!</i> my poor daughter!
She will perish&mdash;she will drown!  Who will save
her?  <i>O Madre de Dios!</i> who will save her?"
exclaimed an old gentleman, rushing in despair along
the quay, wringing his hands, and gesticulating, as
foreigners only do, appealing to several men in
vain.
</p>

<p>
Pedro saw the girl rising and sinking alternately
as her crinoline buoyed her up, and piteously she
shrieked every time she rose.  He coolly measured
the distance from the quay to where she was drowning.
He could swim like a fish; but he thought of
his new finery, so recently donned, and was turning
away, when the unfortunate father rushed forward
and grasped his hands.
</p>

<p>
"Can you swim, senor?" he asked, impetuously.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, a little," replied Pedro, with hesitation.
</p>

<p>
"You can&mdash;you can!"
</p>

<p>
"Like a duck or a dolphin sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"A thousand dollars, if you save my poor girl,
shall be yours!" exclaimed the old man, weeping.
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I can pay you?  Eh, eh.  <i>O Dios mio!</i> she
will drown before my eyes while this wretch chaffers
for her life.  Oh, my Ignez! my Ignez!"
</p>

<p>
"Save her, if you can swim, I command you!"
cried the full, deep voice of the Padre Eizagiuerro,
who rushed forward.  "Quick, senor! he who
implores you to save his child&mdash;his only child&mdash;is the
wealthy Moreno, the richest merchant in the city of
Santiago."
</p>

<p>
"Too late!&mdash;too late!&mdash;she sinks!  Pray to God
for her!" cried a hundred voices.
</p>

<p>
"In, in!" exclaimed the Padres Ugarte and
Eizagiuerro together, for her father was almost
speechless with despair; "in, if you are a
swimmer&mdash;two thousand dollars if you save her!"
</p>

<p>
"Half my fortune&mdash;yea, all, if you will but save
her!" groaned the unhappy father.
</p>

<p>
"Shame! shame!" muttered the crowd.
</p>

<p>
"Two thousand will do&mdash;<i>presto!</i> here goes!"
said Pedro, as he cast his sombrero, poncho, gaudy
jacket and vest, his knife and revolver, to the care
of old Moreno, and plunged into the water amid the
joyous yells of the negroes, and the loud "<i>Vivas!</i>"
of the white and yellow spectators, many of whom
were already stripping as if to anticipate him.
</p>

<p>
Pedro's head of black curly hair was soon seen
to rise above the water as he swam, unerringly as a
Newfoundland dog, to where the man was gesticulating
frantically on the keel of the capsized boat,
and to where the poor girl had sunk.
</p>

<p>
There he dived down, and all who looked on held
their breath for a time; many crossed themselves
very devoutly; the two padres raised their hands
and eyes to heaven, and all the friars were on their
knees, with many of the people.
</p>

<p>
Again a "<i>Viva!</i>" rent the air, as Pedro reappeared,
but a few yards off, with the girl on his
left arm, while he swam vigorously with his right,
and gained the battery steps, even before a boat
could reach her, for which he was by no means
anxious, as he wished to enjoy the entire credit and
profit of the enterprise; but life seemed almost
extinct in the poor creature.
</p>

<p>
"Dead or alive," muttered the heartless Pedro;
"'tis nothing to me; 2,000 dollars are a good
set-off against a wet shirt!"
</p>

<p>
The strong hand of the Padre Eizagieurro grasped
his, and assisted him up the slimy sea stair, where
he placed the senseless and dripping girl in her
father's arms, and then the poor man wept as he
covered her cold, wet cheek with kisses&mdash;the purest
that are ever bestowed in this world; and now the
shouts of "<i>Viva el noble caballero!</i>" that greeted
him on all sides, so applaudingly and so vociferously,
almost made Pedro Barradas believe himself the
disinterested and gallant fellow the simple people
believed him to be.
</p>

<p>
The young gentleman, who clung to the keel of
the inverted boat, was almost immediately rescued
by the crew of a brigantine, in which Pedro
suddenly recognised, to his dismay, the otter-hunter;
but the lady's companion was viewed with singular
displeasure by all.  Even the negroes ventured to
mock him, for Pedro was the hero of the whole
episode!
</p>

<p>
A carriage was summoned; the young lady, in
whom Pedro discovered his beauty of the Matriz
Church, and, who was already reviving, was placed
therein, with her friend, or lover, as he appeared to
be, by his excessive alarm and tenderness.  Her
father insisted on her preserver accompanying them,
and after a little affected demur and diffidence, he
gave an anxious glance at the brigantine, another at
the crowd, lest some of her crew might be there,
and, assenting, took his place beside Moreno.
</p>

<p>
He remembered what the Padre Eizagiuerro had
said so hurriedly, that this old gentleman was the
richest merchant in Santiago, the capital of Chili
(of which the great city of Valparaiso is merely the
port); that the girl he had saved was an only child.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Caramba!</i>" thought he; "I may get the
daughter as well as the 2,000 <i>duros</i>.  Courage,
Pedro, amigo mio, for fortune smiles more than ever!
How lucky it was that little accident occurred on
board the brigantine!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><br />
IGNEZ DE MORENO.
</h3>

<p>
From the mole the carriage was driven to one of
the most splendid hotels in Valparaiso.  Don
Salvador held his daughter in his arms, and hung over
her with great solicitude and affection.  She soon
began to open her eyes, and the swinging motion of
the carriage tended to promote the circulation of
the blood.  She was at once committed to the care
of a medical man and her own attendants, and ere
Pedro had dried his garments, and imbibed a stiff
glass of brandy-and-water, most favourable tidings
of her recovery were brought by her father, old
Don Salvador, who insisted that Pedro should stay
and sup with him, promising, that if Donna Ignez
were sufficiently recovered ere he left them&mdash;which
there was no reason to doubt&mdash;her preserver should
be introduced to her.
</p>

<p>
"Bravo!" thought Pedro, as he approvingly
glanced at himself askance in a great mirror, that
ascended from the marble mantelpiece under which
the gilt brassero smouldered, to the lofty frescoed
ceiling; "bravo, Pedro!&mdash;so far so well!"
</p>

<p>
A supper, consisting chiefly of light dishes, fruit,
and rare wines, served up in costly plate and
splendid crystal, made Pedro's eyes twinkle, and
ere the last flush of sunset had faded away on the
Pacific, of which they had a fine view from the
open windows of the hotel, they were joined by
the Padres Eizagiuerro and Ugarte (whose presence
Pedro could very well have spared); for the former
was the confessor of Donna Ignez, and the latter
was an old friend of her family.
</p>

<p>
Don Perez, the young man who had cut such a
sorry figure on the keel of the inverted boat, also
joined the party, but he was silent, reserved, and
dissatisfied.
</p>

<p>
"Pardon me, senor," began Salvador de Moreno&mdash;a
benevolent-looking old gentleman, whose silky
hair was white as snow, though his face, which was
noble in feature, wore a deep ruddy brown
hue&mdash;"pardon me," he continued, after having expressed
his gratitude in the most extravagant terms; "but
may I inquire the name of a gentleman to whom
my daughter owes her life, and I so much?"
</p>

<p>
Now, Pedro had not thought of a name to
assume; but, with all the ready wit of a rogue, he
at once foresaw that to adopt any <i>other</i> Christian
cognomen than his own might prove awkward, if he
forgot it, or failed to keep his cue, so he replied:
</p>

<p>
"Don Pedro Florez de Serrano."
</p>

<p>
The old merchant bowed very low indeed, for the
name sounded well, and somehow not unfamiliar.
</p>

<p>
"You have served&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"In the navy&mdash;yes," said Pedro, hastily.
</p>

<p>
"Ah&mdash;I thought so."
</p>

<p>
"Curse his clever eyes!" thought Pedro; "there
is no concealing a sailor's hands."
</p>

<p>
Ere this, he had discovered a necessity for
concealing this circumstance, which had always excited
suspicions of his assumed character, for his hands
were, of course, browned by tar and exposure, and
hardened by tallying on to ropes, cables, and
capstan-bars.  He resolved to invest in a box of kid
gloves forthwith, and to account for his nautical
bearing, said:
</p>

<p>
"I am a lieutenant in the navy of the Southern
States, on parole not to serve during the war against
the North.  I belonged to that famous ship, the
<i>Florida</i>."
</p>

<p>
Don Salvador and the two padres bowed again,
while Don Perez, a pale, but rather handsome young
man, on whom Pedro's sharp eye turned from time
to time, stared before him straight at his
wine-glass, and looked, if possible, more discontented
than ever.
</p>

<p>
"Jealous already, my old friend of the Matriz
Church!&mdash;ho! ho!" thought Pedro.
</p>

<p>
"As your name is Florez," said the Padre Ugarte,
"may I inquire whether you are any relation of
Don Florez de&mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>

<p>
Here the priest named a famous Spanish grandee.
On which the adventurous Pedro promptly replied,
while holding his glass to the liveried and aiguiletted
servant, to be filled with hock, iced and sparkling,
for the sixth time:
</p>

<p>
"I am no relation whatever, I believe&mdash;only a
namesake."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!"
</p>

<p>
"Since the death of my uncle, the Corregidor of
Ciudad Rodrigo, in the old country, I have only one
relation in the world."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, indeed!" remarked Padre Eizagiuerro, who
seemed to be studying Pedro closely with his small,
keen eyes.
</p>

<p>
"My father's cousin," he resumed, with a steady
stare, which somewhat abashed the worthy ecclesiastic.
</p>

<p>
"May I inquire?" asked Perez, who had not yet
spoken.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly&mdash;old Serrano, the Captain-General of
Cuba."
</p>

<p>
"El Mariscal Duque de Serrano!" exclaimed
Ugarte.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly&mdash;do you know him, Senor Padre?"
continued Pedro, with affected carelessness, while
rolling up a paper cigarito, knowing well that the
truth of this bold statement would never be tested in
the Republic of Chili; and though a citizen thereof,
Don Salvador now bowed very low indeed, for he
had enough of the old Spaniard in his disposition
to have a respect, bordering on awe, for long names
and long pedigrees.  The priests glanced at each
other doubtfully, but remained silent, for they were
more acute men of the world than their worthy host.
</p>

<p>
"And how came you among us here in Chili?"
asked Perez.
</p>

<p>
"Simply by a stroke of fortune, senor.  My
parole cuts me off indefinitely from naval employment;
my cousin will do nothing for me, either in
Castile or in Cuba, so I have come here to kill time
by travelling, attended by a young fellow named
Zuares, a faithful servant, whom I have lost; so I
find myself," added Pedro, who, thanks to the
tutelage of the old Bishop of Orizaba, could express
himself well when he chose, "by the great shores of
the Pacific without a single friend."
</p>

<p>
"Do not say so, I entreat you, Senor Don Pedro,"
exclaimed old Moreno, impulsively, as he shook the
speaker's hands; "oh," he added, while his eyes
filled, "how much do I owe you, <i>Madre de Dios!</i>&mdash;how much?"
</p>

<p>
("Two thousand dollars, my golden pigeon!"
thought Pedro.)
</p>

<p>
"I shall be your friend, senor, and so must our
kinsman Perez."
</p>

<p>
Don Perez mumbled some reply half in his wine-glass,
for he evidently viewed our adventurer with
no favourable eyes.  Indeed, though loving his
young cousin Ignez with all his soul, he had scarcely
grace to thank Pedro for fishing her up from the
bottom of the bay.  Perez de Moreno was rather a
handsome young man; his black hair was shorn
short, and he had smart moustaches, that stuck
straight out right and left, terminating in sharp
points, and his costume, though provincial, became
him well.
</p>

<p>
He wore a short, round jacket of dark figured
silk (surtouts and swallow-tails are unknown in
these regions); a rich vest of scarlet satin; a shirt
open at the neck, fastened by gold studs, in the
centre of each of which a diamond flashed; long,
straight pantaloons of chocolate-coloured velvet,
girt by a sash of yellow silk; a broad-brimmed
brown beaver, encircled by a gold band;
straw-coloured kid gloves, and a knife concealed
somewhere, no doubt, completed his attire.
</p>

<p>
As yet not a word had been said about the
dollars, and notwithstanding his chivalrous
character and high connections, our friend Pedro was
getting impatient on the subject, and was very well
pleased when it was referred to, with a covert sneer,
by Don Perez.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, true, true, Dios mio!  I had forgotten,"
exclaimed Don Salvador, producing a gilt morocco
pocket-book, and opening it hastily; but Pedro,
knowing well the character of the merchant, and
having a deep and ultimate game in view, declined
to receive a single dollar for the service rendered.
Don Salvador expostulated, remonstrated, and was
almost indignant, while Pedro rose fifty per cent. in
the estimation of the two priests.  At last, he could
with difficulty, apparently, be prevailed upon "to
accept, as his remittances from Charleston had been
delayed," a cheque from his host, on the bank of
Santiago, for 1,000 dollars.
</p>

<p>
"We leave this to-morrow for Santiago, where
we reside.  I should like my daughter to see you
ere we go; but I find that, if she is well enough, we
must start by sunrise.  If you should ever visit our
city, don't forget us, senor&mdash;don't forget us, I
beseech you," and the old gentleman presented
his card, on which was engraved the name and
address:
</p>

<p>
"<i>Don Salvador de Moreno, Alameda de la Canada.</i>"
</p>

<p>
"I shall not forget, be assured, senor," said Pedro,
pocketing the cheque and the card; and now,
thinking, as the lights were beginning to multiply,
that the time had come when it would be prudent
to take his departure, he solemnly, and with much
profuse politeness, bade his intended father-in-law
adieu, for in this relationship he actually viewed
Don Salvador already.  "I have some business to
transact, about&mdash;about&mdash;but it does not matter
what, so I shall not be long behind you here."
</p>

<p>
He remembered the brigantine at anchor in the
bay, and resolved to quit Valparaiso without loss
of time.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Adios</i>, Padre Ugarte&mdash;Padre Eizagiuerro,
<i>adios</i>!" said he, waving his hat, and yawing some
what in his course towards the door; "<i>adios</i>, Don
Perez; don't forget to learn to swi&mdash;swi&mdash;swim.  A
thousand farewells to you, Don Salvador."
</p>

<p>
Fortunately the door was promptly opened by a
servant, or Pedro would have lurched against its
panels of plate-glass, and ere long he found himself
in the street, with his back against a lamp-post, and
very dim ideas of how he had quitted the hotel.
Then he thought Don Perez had insulted him, and a
vague notion of returning and punching that
individual's head floated through his own.
</p>

<p>
The cool breeze from the Pacific partly sobered
him; he wrapped his poncho round him; felt if the
cheque was safe; and, then, remembering that he
was in a strange place, he searched next for his
knife and revolver.
</p>

<p>
"All right&mdash;<i>bueno!</i>"&mdash;he hiccuped, "now for the
Posada de San Augustin.  The church is just opposite
the posada&mdash;no, it is the posada that is opposite
the church, <i>amigo mio</i>."
</p>

<p>
Though tipsy, he reflected that he had a heavy
bill due there; but as he had not the slightest
intention of liquidating it, the expenses of a night
more would matter little, as he meant to depart for
Santiago on the morrow and follow up his fortune
there without delay.
</p>

<p>
Pedro lay long a-bed next day for divers weighty
reasons.  He had a crushing headache&mdash;the result
of iced champagne, moselle, sherry, and brandy-punch;
he had to remember all the little romances
he had invented for the behoof of Don Salvador and
the jealous Don Perez; he also deemed it safer to
keep out of the way till nightfall&mdash;even though
skilfully disguised&mdash;than to wander about Valparaiso
while that devilish brigantine (he could see her from
the posada windows) was anchored off the battery.
</p>

<p>
Among other things, Pedro reflected that he must
get rid of Don Perez, whom he already hated as a
rival.
</p>

<p>
He knew well that attentions to the fair sex must
be gone warily about under the shadow of the
Andes; for though the women of South America
are handsome and gay, their ideas of morality are
somewhat cloudy and vague, hence the jealousy of
the men is extreme, their vengeance deadly and
sudden.  Spanish and Indian blood make a fiery
mixture in that land of earthquakes and volcanoes.
</p>

<p>
Gallantry to women, married or single, is often
repaid by the bullet or stiletto of a parent or lover;
and yet what a certain writer says of California suits
Chili, or any other of these regions, equally well,
for there the very men who would lay down their
lives to avenge the honour of their own family,
would risk the same lives to complete the dishonour
of another.
</p>

<p>
But the intentions of Senor Don Pedro Florez de
Serrano, of the Southern navy, were strictly honourable.
He contemplated nothing but matrimony.
</p>

<p>
Some woman he meant to marry; whether she
was a princess or a <i>paisano</i>, whether, like Ignez, the
heiress of uncounted pistoles, or the pretty keeper
of a <i>taberna</i>, mattered nothing to him provided she
could supply all his little exigences till he grew tired
of her, slipped his cable and ran off to sea again.
</p>

<p>
So now an opportunity of the most golden and
unexpected kind&mdash;one favoured by fortune and
those good old romantic accessories of all lovers and
novelists&mdash;to wit, gratitude and adventure, had
suddenly opened up to him.
</p>

<p>
It seemed that he had but to go in and win.  He
was the rescuer from death of an heiress, young,
beautiful, tender, and simple "as a sucking turkey,"
to use one of his own peculiar forecastle phrases; so
he leaped from bed about mid-day, called for a long
glass of brandy and potash iced, to assist in clearing
his faculties, after which he began to consider in
what fashion he would "levant" from the Posada
de San Augustin and set out for Santiago, without
seeking for his bill, to attempt which, when he had
but ten dollars in hand, would only have been an
insult to his worthy host, Felipe Fernandez, whom,
he had no desire to offend.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><br />
HOW PEDRO PROVIDED HIMSELF WITH A HORSE AND VALET.
</h3>

<p>
Santiago lies sixty miles south-west of Valparaiso
towards the Andes, a rough and hilly road.  To
proceed there on foot by no means suited Pedro's
ideas of locomotion, while to travel by any kind of
vehicle might lead to detection and other serious
annoyances, so, as evening approached, and Pedro
considered that old Moreno and his daughter must
have had ten or twelve hours' start, he became sorely
perplexed.
</p>

<p>
The sun set, the moon rose, and still Pedro was
undecided.
</p>

<p>
Slowly, solemnly, and majestically that broad,
round silver moon ascended from the calm waters of
the Pacific.  White as snow shone all the plastered
streets of Valparaiso, and the sea that rolled rippling
into the bay, between the embattled forts, seemed a
sheet of liquid sheen; but in the blue sky her
silver light struggled for supremacy with a lurid
red cast&mdash;not upon the clouds, for there were
none&mdash;but upon the very ether itself, by the flames that
were now shooting upward from the vast cone of
Aconcagua.
</p>

<p>
From the windows of the front drawing-room, or
large public saloon of the posada, which opened
towards the bay, Pedro sauntered, sunk in thought
and rage&mdash;perplexity always took that form with
him&mdash;to those of the back, which overlooked the
stable-yard, and there a violent altercation arrested
his attention.  It was taking place between no less
a personage than Felipe Fernandez and a horseman
who had just arrived.
</p>

<p>
"I have ridden from the Maypo River," said the
latter, "and must put up here."
</p>

<p>
"A short distance, senor, and your horse is quite
fresh," replied the host; "it is useless dismounting,
as I cannot accommodate you."
</p>

<p>
"Why?" asked the other, with a malediction
which sounded familiar to the ear of Pedro.
</p>

<p>
"We have no room."
</p>

<p>
"Bah!  I have been told that elsewhere."
</p>

<p>
"Very likely," replied the host, drily, as he
turned to retire.
</p>

<p>
"If you have no room inside, just shove a pole
out of the upper window, and I'll roost on that in
California fashion," urged the speaker, as he
deliberately dismounted, and, taking the lasso from his
saddlebow, threw it over his arm; "I must have a
bottle of wine, at least, ere I look for other
diggings&mdash;<i>caramba</i>."
</p>

<p>
This interjection made Pedro regard the stranger
more closely as he passed from where he had
fastened his horse, and crossed the yard in the full
blaze of the moonlight.  Then Barradas ground his
teeth as he recognised Cramply Hawkshaw, whom
he had not met since that afternoon of crime in the
Barranca Secca; and he was quite as much enraged
and bewildered on seeing Hawkshaw there in the
Posada de San Augustin as that personage had
been on beholding him when perched on the yard-arm
of the <i>Hermione</i>, on that evening after she left
London.
</p>

<p>
But Pedro's measures were rapidly taken; already
he heard the footsteps of him he must avoid
ascending the broad marble-staircase of the hotel!  Save
his poncho, knife, and revolver, Pedro had no
luggage that he cared about, so he thrust the weapons
in his sash, threw the poncho over his shoulders,
stuck his sombrero fiercely on his head, and brushed
past Hawkshaw just as that person entered the
room.
</p>

<p>
Descending quickly to the stable-yard, Pedro
went straight to where Hawkshaw's horse was
standing in shadow, and after deliberately giving a
glance at the bit and bridle, and lengthening the
stirrup-leathers, to suit himself, he mounted, rode
softly out of the stable-yard, and before Captain
Hawkshaw, late of the Texan Partisan Rangers, had
finished his wine, and had another expostulation
with the <i>maestro de casa</i>, who either knew him of
old, or disliked his trapper-like equipment, Pedro
was fully three miles from Valparaiso, and was
ascending, at a slow pace, of course, the steep and
winding path which led to one of the many ravines
in the mountain range that overhangs the city.
</p>

<p>
The horse had come from the Maypo River that
day, as Hawkshaw stated; but it was strong and
active, being one of that degenerated breed of
Spanish chargers, which are to be met with,
sometimes in herds of 10,000, on the vast plains which
extend from the shores of La Plata to the mountains
of Patagonia.  His head was broad; his legs
clumsy; he was long-eared, rough-coated, and of
a chestnut bay colour; but, like his brethren of
the grassy prairies, he was possessed of great
strength and spirit, and thus ascended the rough
mountain path with unflagging zeal; but not so
quickly as to prevent another horse, whose hoofs
were heard behind, from gaining on him as they
entered the ravine in the hills, where their
galloping was re-echoed by the overhanging volcanic
rocks.
</p>

<p>
Pedro's hasty flight, together with the disappearance
of the horse of the unwelcome visitor, who
now stormed, and threatened to complain to the
nearest alcalde, having excited the suspicion of the
host, and a gust of rage in the breast of Hawkshaw,
the latter, on hearing of the ponderous and
immovable trunk, suggested that it should at once be
examined, for, being aware of every species of trick
under the sun, he at once suspected that it was full
alone of emptiness.
</p>

<p>
Promptly acting on this alarming suggestion,
Fernandez burst it open, and then nothing was seen
in it, save the heads of the screws that secured it to
the floor.  He tore his hair, said many irreverent
things of poor San Augustin, the patron of his
posada, and leaping on one of his own horses, after
a few inquiries, started in pursuit of the runaway
along the Santiago road.
</p>

<p>
His horse being one of those which are imported
from San Domingo, was of pure Castilian breeding,
and rapidly overtook the Chilian nag ridden by
Pedro, whom Fernandez soon recognised in the
moonlight, as he jogged along, with his toes turned
out and his elbows squared, and whom he summoned
to stop, just as they gained the wildest part of the
ravine, where the hills overhung it darkly, though
at its western end, far down below, could be seen
white Valparaiso, its deep-blue bay and shipping, its
lighted thoroughfares, its spires and convents, spread
out like a fairy map in the silver sheen.
</p>

<p>
"Hollo!" answered Pedro, reining up, "who
are you that follow a gentleman thus, shouting on
the road like a drunken Indian?  What&mdash;is it you,
Senor Fernandez?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, tis I," replied the landlord, breathless
alike with rage and his hasty ride, yet resolving to
dissemble a little; "permit me to expostulate with
you, senor, on the double mistake you have
committed."
</p>

<p>
"Mistake&mdash;I?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, senor!"
</p>

<p>
"Explain yourself, and quickly too," replied
Pedro, fiercely, as he grasped the revolver under his
poncho.
</p>

<p>
"You have taken a stranger's horse from my
house, and departed without paying the bill."
</p>

<p>
"I have left baggage, fellow," Pedro was
beginning, with great loftiness.
</p>

<p>
"Only an empty box," interrupted Fernandez,
but with rather a quavering voice, when remembering
with deep mortification that he had come on
this errand unarmed.
</p>

<p>
"You know Don Salvador de Moreno?"
</p>

<p>
"Perfectly."
</p>

<p>
"I have here a cheque of his for a large sum,
sir," said Pedro, producing the old merchant's
stamped paper.  "What change have you about
you?"
</p>

<p>
"I regret, senor, that I have only twenty
pistoles," said the landlord, with sudden affability;
"yes&mdash;just twenty, and a few dollars."
</p>

<p>
"All of which I require you to hand over instantly,
or I shall send this bullet through your brain!"
cried Pedro, with an oath, as he levelled the revolver
full at the head of the startled Fernandez.
</p>

<p>
The latter saw the steel barrel glittering in the
moonlight; he saw the caps on the breech; and he
saw, too, that there was no misunderstanding the
fierce glitter in the eyes of Pedro.  The path was
lonely, and no aid was nigh.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Presto!</i>" roared Pedro; "I have no time to spare."
</p>

<p>
With a reluctance that was no way feigned,
Fernandez gave his purse, which Pedro thrust into
his pocket.
</p>

<p>
"Now, senor," said Fernandez, "I beseech you
to give me the horse, for which I must account to
Captain Hawkshaw, as he left it on my premises."
</p>

<p>
Pedro laughed aloud on hearing this request.
</p>

<p>
"Harkye, shipmate, he rides seldom who only
rides borrowed horses; so I ride seldom, and, being
a sailor, don't overlike it.  Captain Hawkshaw is an
old friend of mine, and may find his horse if he
inquires at Quillota."  (This was said to mislead the
landlord as to his route.)  "All my little mistakes
are rectified now, I think, eh?  <i>Adios</i>!  I shall
always recommend the Posada de San Augustin to
my friends.  Your cooking is admirable, your wines
ditto.  Be assured alike of my boundless custom
and most distinguished consideration when next I
visit your beautiful city of Valparaiso."
</p>

<p>
And thus bantering, the ruffian rode off, leaving
Fernandez, speechless with rage, to retrace his steps
or enjoy the moonlight among the mountains, as he
chose, on very bad terms, however, with his patron,
San Augustin, whom he believed had handed him
over to the Evil One.
</p>

<p>
Pedro's horse, if not swift, had good mettle in
him, and trotted steadily eastward up the ascent,
towards the higher ranges of hills, and ere long no
less than four volcanic peaks were visible, all flaming
at once, like the cones of a mighty natural furnace,
and casting from afar off a glow of fire even to the
zenith.
</p>

<p>
At midnight, the moonshine was still glorious.
Pedro had ridden more than half-way to Santiago&mdash;thirty
miles&mdash;so he stopped to rest himself, rather
than the poor horse, in a little dell amid groves of
mimosa trees, where parroquets, flame-coloured and
green, chattered amid the branches; where the tall
ceibas, or cotton-wood timber, cast their shadows on
a deep and reedy lagune, whereon the giant water-flowers
of that tropical region floated, and where,
for coolness, the picaflor, or little humming-bird,
nestled in their cups by day.
</p>

<p>
Though a South American, Pedro, as a seaman,
had been long unused to the saddle.  He felt as if
all his bones had been mangled; wearily he threw
the bridle over the stump of a broken tree, and
stretched himself on the grass, while his nag drank
of the lagune.
</p>

<p>
On the whole, Pedro was greatly pleased with
himself.  He had Don Salvador's bill for 1,000
dollars; he had ten dollars yet remaining of the
plunder from the brigantine, and he had twenty
pistoles and four dollars just taken from Fernandez.
Then there was Hawkshaw's horse, which, with its
furniture, he valued at 500 more.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Vamas!</i>" thought he; "at this rate I shall soon
realise a fortune."
</p>

<p>
While Pedro was thus casting up this little sum,
gained by his industry, he did not perceive a dark,
lithe, and athletic young fellow, who had been
lurking among the luxuriant weeds, and who now stole
stealthily towards him, with a knife glittering in his
hand; and little thought Pedro that the clink of his
ill-gotten pistoles had been overheard.
</p>

<p>
This stealthy personage wore a red baize shirt, a
yellow poncho cloak, or <i>surreppa</i>, an old-fashioned
Spanish hat, much broken and bruised, and long
brown leather leggings.
</p>

<p>
He had a calf-skin girdle, fastened to which by a
thong the sheath of his knife was dangling, beside
an Indian bota, or drinking-flask.
</p>

<p>
Gliding like a serpent or eel, he was close to
Pedro, ere a sound made the latter turn sharply,
with instinctive caution.
</p>

<p>
Each uttered an imprecation&mdash;an expletive not to
be found in Johnson or Walker&mdash;there was a gleam
of the lurker's knife, and a flash of Pedro's pistol, as
they closed suddenly, and, without harming each
other, suddenly drew back.
</p>

<p>
"Pedro!"
</p>

<p>
"Zuares!"
</p>

<p>
Such were the exclamations that escaped the lips
of these worthies, just in time to prevent a little
culpable fratricide.
</p>

<p>
The brothers now exchanged an account of their
adventures since they had scuttled the boat of the
brigantine at the harbour of the Almendral, and
separated, each to shift for himself.
</p>

<p>
Those of Zuares were very simple, being merely
the breaking of all the commandments, and spending
his dollars in such a fashion that the atmosphere of
Valparaiso became too hot for his comfort, and he
was now travelling inland, to avoid the chance of
being legally garotted in a city where there was
no Sangrado equalling our friend Heriot in a skill
calculated to baffle even Calcraft.
</p>

<p>
But Pedro's narrative and intentions filled Zuares
with genuine admiration and envy of his brother,
the part of whose valet he promptly resolved to
personate, in the prosecution of their scheme upon
the funds and family of Don Salvador de Moreno,
the account of whose simplicity, together with the
beauty of Donna Ignez, he vowed to be quite
delightful.
</p>

<p>
"Of course.  <i>Corpo Santo!</i> a rich man's only
daughter is always lovely," said Pedro; "but now,
Zuares, <i>hermano mio</i>, you must remember all I have
said, particularly about our&mdash;I mean <i>my</i> noble
relatives."
</p>

<p>
"I have spelt them all over, I think.  There is
Serrano, Captain-General of Ciudad Rodrigo, and
your cousin, Don Florez, who is alcalde of
Cuba&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No, no, no!" exclaimed Pedro; "at this rate
you will play the devil with me.  I am Don Pedro
Florez de Serrano, cousin to the Captain-General
of Cuba; my late uncle was corregidor of Ciudad
Rodrigo, as rich and as pious as you please."
</p>

<p>
"And you&mdash;you are&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"A lieutenant of the Southern Navy on parole;
which will account for my brown hands, and other
shortcomings in the matter of gentility.  You&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I am a most attached and faithful servant."
</p>

<p>
"A regular Sancho.  You have your cue?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Por vida del demonio</i>, what a game!"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Glorioso!  Vamos</i> (come)!"
</p>

<p>
And the two rascals laughed heartily as they
resumed the road that led to Santiago, chatting,
and fraternally riding by turns the horse of
Hawkshaw, which now, poor animal, began to droop its
head and ears in weariness.

CHAPTER XV.
<br /><br />
THE ALAMEDA DE LA CANADA.
</h3>

<p>
"That Fortune is not nice in her morality," says
Maria Edgeworth; "that she frequently favours
those who do not adhere to truth more than those
who do, we have early had occasion to observe.  But
whether fortune may not be in this, as in all the
rest, treacherous and capricious&mdash;whether she may
not by her first smiles and favours, lure her victims
to their cost, to their utter undoing at last, remains
to be seen."
</p>

<p>
And so it remains to be seen how far the blind
goddess favoured Pedro and his well-beloved brother,
Zuares.
</p>

<p>
Towards the close of the next day, they drew near
the great city of Santiago, and meeting a muleteer,
who was travelling towards Quillota, with a train of
mules, laden with jerked beef and hemp, they
further improved their financial resources by selling
to him the horse of Hawkshaw, with bridle and
saddle, for 100 dollars, and the muleteer was too
well pleased with his bargain to make any particular
inquiries respecting it; but took the precaution,
after he left the sellers, to halt in the first peach
grove, and shear off the horse's mane, dock his tail
and forelock, and otherwise disguise him.
</p>

<p>
On entering Santiago, to avoid any further
mistakes, Pedro proceeded at once to get Don
Salvador's cheque turned into hard cash of the
Chilian Republic.  Then he had the somewhat
picturesque costume of Zuares changed for a
handsome suit of Spanish livery; and, thirdly, he
betook himself to the Alameda de la Canada, just as
the streets were being lighted, in search of the
house of the Morenos.
</p>

<p>
The Alameda of Santiago is, perhaps, the most
magnificent promenade in any of the South
American cities.  It is more than 150 years old.
Measuring 1,000 yards in length, it is divided into
three stately walks, on each side of which runs a
carriage-way.  There are also three canals, which
intersect it, and six rows of gigantic poplars.
</p>

<p>
Here is also the ancient convent of St. Francis,
with a church built of pure white stone, having a
lofty steeple, from the galleries of which may be
seen the fertile vale that stretches to the base of
the Andes&mdash;the land of gold and of fire.
</p>

<p>
The stone seats were all occupied by ladies.  All
were gay, and many of them were beautiful.  Their
lace mantillas were all thrown back, to float over
their shoulders, for the evening was warm, and all
their large feather fans were at work.
</p>

<p>
Gentlemen in sombreros hovered round their seats
in hundreds, and the fine band of a Lancer regiment
of the Chilian Republic played near the octagon
fountain, at the foot of the centre walk, and filled
the ambient air with the strains of "Il Trovatore."
</p>

<p>
The December evening was lovely, as well as
warm (the thermometer rises to 85 degrees there in
January), and the yellow glory of the set sun yet
lingered on the giant summits of the snow-clad
Andes, shaded off into saffron, purple, and dark blue
in the ravines and valleys, through which roll those
rivers that mingle their gold-dust with the sand on
the shores of the Pacific&mdash;the Rio Monte and the
Aconcagua, whose banks are bordered by groves of
the orange, the fig, the peach, and the pomegranate,
for in Chili the land teems with all that can minister
to luxury and to wealth.
</p>

<p>
Accompanied by his valet, who walked at a
respectful distance behind, bearing his poncho and
umbrella, our acquaintance, Don Pedro Florez,
walked along the Alameda, with a cigar in his
mouth, his sombrero stuck very much over his right
eye, and both hands thrust into his trousers pockets.
He peered or leered into the faces of all the ladies
with an air of assurance that he might not have
adopted, had he and Zuares not recently dined.  He
inquired of a water-carrier for the mansion of Don
Salvador, and it was speedily pointed out to him.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Demonio!</i>" thought Pedro, as he ascended the
broad flight of marble steps in front; "it is a
regular palace, this!  And what if Donna Ignez
should have been too ill to travel after her cold
bath?&mdash;she may be still at Valparaiso."
</p>

<p>
Pedro was somewhat scared, and Zuares was so
completely, by the magnitude and magnificent
aspect of the mansion, the door of which was open,
revealing a lighted vestibule, and lamps were
shining through nearly all of its lofty windows.
The balconies were richly gilded; the Venetian
blinds were all up, and thus the rich curtains, the
draperies, and gilded ceilings of the apartments
could be seen from the Alameda.
</p>

<p>
Don Salvador was at home.
</p>

<p>
Pedro took his cloak from his valet, whom he
told, with great condescension, to amuse himself for
the remainder of the evening at the dancing-rooms,
but to be at their hotel before midnight.  Zuares
touched his hat, with his tongue in his cheek, while
his brother was ushered into the <i>ante-cámera</i>, or
drawing-room, where Don Salvador, Don Perez, and
Padre Eizagiuerro (whom he could very well have
spared) received him with great politeness; but the
first alone with any cordiality.
</p>

<p>
Coffee and chocolate were being served round,
and Donna Ignez came forward, blushing and
smiling, to be presented to her "brave preserver."
</p>

<p>
She was, evidently, of pure Spanish blood; her
pale brunette complexion showing clearly that there
was no native mixture in her blue veins; while her
eyes, and their lashes and brows, were black as night.
</p>

<p>
As Pedro surveyed the girl's pure loveliness, not
her least attractions seemed to be her necklace, her
long pendant ear-rings, her bracelets, and high
Spanish comb, all <i>en suite</i>&mdash;all blood-red rubies,
which sparkled all the brighter for the snowy pearls
that mingled with them in settings of richly-chased
gold, for Pedro Barradas had the eye and heart of a
pirate.
</p>

<p>
Two sisters of the pale and discontented Don
Perez were present&mdash;Donna Erminia, a tall and
magnificent girl (whose broad white shoulders and
large proportions made Pedro wish that she had
been the merchant's daughter), and little Donna
Paula, who was only some ten years old or so, but
who seemed a miniature edition of Erminia, with a
high comb, fan, and veil, a demure little face, and
calm, black, inquiring eyes.  She sat on a velvet
hassock near the knee of Don Salvador, with whom
she was an especial favourite.
</p>

<p>
All unused to society such as this, Pedro was
sorely abashed for a time, till his natural impudence
came to his aid.  His past education, and his service
as a boy in the cathedral church of Orizaba, he now
recalled with success, and the knowledge he had
gained of clerical matters, served him in his
endeavours to cast "dust in the eyes" of the Padre
Eizagiuerro as to his real character, and yet, withal,
the priest mistrusted him.
</p>

<p>
He saw that there was something unreal about
this Don Pedro&mdash;that he was not a gentleman of
Spain, or any other place; and as for the Padre
Ugarte, he suspected something worse than mere
imposture.  Yet, veiling the native ferocity of his
character, Pedro was now humble, fawning, and
discreet&mdash;oh! exceedingly discreet!  He had a
great game to play&mdash;a rich end in view.
</p>

<p>
"We met, senor, once before that accident,"
said Donna Ignez, looking up with a bright smile in
her soft eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, senora," replied Pedro.
</p>

<p>
"At the Matriz Church&mdash;ah, you remember!"
</p>

<p>
"Could I ever forget?" was the gallant response.
</p>

<p>
"And the sermon?'
</p>

<p>
"It was divine," said Pedro, in a low voice, but
yet distinct enough to reach the ear of the padre.
</p>

<p>
So now they were friends at once, to an extent
that cousin Perez could neither understand nor
relish.
</p>

<p>
Though, when inflamed by his potations, a mad
ruffian, as we have shown by his proceedings on
board the <i>Hermione</i>, Pedro was not altogether
destitute of the subtle art of winning female favour&mdash;the
art in which his father excelled so fatally, and
which was the only inheritance he had left him&mdash;so
he exerted every energy to please the fair young
Ignez, and to use with industry the time that fortune
gave him.
</p>

<p>
So, after detailing a very bloody engagement
between the ships of the Federals and Confederates,
in which he alleged he was wounded and left for
dead on the enemy's deck, he suddenly affected to
discover a new source for deep interest in Donna
Ignez&mdash;a close and most remarkable resemblance
which she bore to "a sister, whom he loved dearly."
</p>

<p>
"Where does she reside?" asked Donna Erminia;
"in Spain?"
</p>

<p>
"Dear old Spain, of which papa talks so much,"
added her cousin Ignez.
</p>

<p>
"Alas! no," said Pedro, beginning to cudgel his
invention.
</p>

<p>
"Is she dead?" asked Ignez, gently.
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Then she must be married, of course?" said
little Donna Paula, fanning herself with all the air
of her great-grandmother.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;she became a nun, in spite of my advice,"
said Pedro, sighing; "one of the sisters of Santa
Clara."
</p>

<p>
"Where, senor?" asked Erminia; "we are very
curious, you see; but it is the privilege of our sex."
</p>

<p>
"At Orizaba; and it was long before our good
friend, the bishop, who was her godfather&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, you know the Bishop of Orizaba, do you,
senor?" said the Padre Eizagiuerro, coming
suddenly forward.
</p>

<p>
"Perfectly, padre," replied Pedro, wishing his
tongue had been bitten off.
</p>

<p>
"Probably you have heard the story of the miraculous
image, which came back to the cathedral in the
night?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; but at that time I was on board the
<i>Florida</i>."
</p>

<p>
"I have just had a letter from the bishop about it."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, padre," stammered Pedro, beginning to
feel far from comfortable, as the padre began to
search the pockets of his soutan.
</p>

<p>
"Dear me&mdash;dear me&mdash;&mdash;where can I have put it?&mdash;he
is an old college friend of mine&mdash;I have left it
in my vestry; but, senor, you will be glad to learn
that they have now distinct traces of the impious
thief, who so sacrilegiously stole the thirteen
diamond stars and the golden aureole from the holy
image of Our Lady."
</p>

<p>
Pedro, who had hitherto been piling falsehood
upon falsehood, winced at this communication, and
felt himself grow pale; but, to his infinite relief, the
padre turned away to address Don Salvador.
</p>

<p>
"Talking of thieves, ladies," said Pedro, "I had
a robber encounter last night, on the hills above
Valparaiso."
</p>

<p>
"An encounter&mdash;<i>Madre de Dios</i>&mdash;of what nature?"
</p>

<p>
And, thereupon, Pedro proceeded to detail a very
spirited scuffle, in which he must have perished, as
he had at least fifteen assailants, but for the
unexpected arrival of his servant, the faithful Zuares.
</p>

<p>
"The man you lost at Valparaiso, senor?" said
Moreno.
</p>

<p>
"Exactly&mdash;the same brave fellow."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Don Pedro, this is romance upon romance!"
exclaimed Ignez, as, with two very white hands, she
smoothed back the dark masses of her magnificent
hair, evidently greatly pleased with the impostor, to
whose rhodomontades she listened as a charming
and romantic young lady, whose life has just been
saved by a striking, athletic, and imposing dark
stranger, may be supposed to do.
</p>

<p>
Her cousin and <i>fiancé</i>, who had clung for life or
death to the keel of the pinnace, which he had
overset by mismanagement, was fearfully at a
discount&mdash;even little Donna Paula did not mind him a
bit; and of this state of matters Don Pedro Florez,
cousin of the Marshal Duke de Serrano, hastened
ito make the best use, for he could temper his
assurance with vast art when he chose, affecting actually
to be timid and shy&mdash;he "had always been so, when
studying at Salamanca," as he whispered to Ignez,
when seated at the piano.
</p>

<p>
He soon cherished a love (if we may call it so)
for this unsuspecting girl; but, like the love that
Hawkshaw bore for Ethel Basset, the lust of lucre
was its basis&mdash;recklessness and obstinacy did the
rest.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, a long, weary, and somewhat
tame engagement with her cousin&mdash;an understood
affair, that had lasted all her girlhood&mdash;rendered
Ignez, perhaps, more open to the advances of a
stranger, by the very novelty of his attentions.
</p>

<p>
After making an appointment to drive with the
whole party to the beautiful valley of Mepooho
next day, Pedro returned to his hotel extremely well
pleased with himself, and just in time to prevent
Zuares, who had been imbibing too freely in the
Reeoba, or market-place, from being carried off by the
horse-police, for drawing his knife on the waiters,
kissing the chambermaids, and other little
eccentricities.
</p>

<p>
Pedro made such admirable use of the opportunities
afforded by that expedition to the valley, and
others, in which the young ladies took him to see
the Jesuits' Church, the Chapel of Our Lady del
Rosario, the great Church of La Campagnia, and
other public sights, that he had thrice spoken of
love to Ignez, who only blushed and smiled, but did
not forbid him, or seek to avoid the subject, unless
when Perez or her father were within hearing, when
a quick warning glance from her charming eyes
withheld him.  Thus the heedless girl, unfortunately
for herself, established with him a species of
secret understanding, which made Pedro conceive
a very daring scheme indeed&mdash;to compel her to
become his by a <i>coup-de-main</i>, as he dreaded the
result of the padre's correspondence with the bishop,
and an exposure of his escapade at the Posada de
San Augustin.
</p>

<p>
More than one painful and unpleasant scene
ensued between Ignez and her cousin Perez now.  She
was piqued, and he was furious; hence the coldness
that ensued between them favoured the adventurous
Pedro.  Yet poor Don Perez loved the wilful girl to
distraction, as the phrase is.
</p>

<p>
He was too feeble to compete in bodily strength
with such a bulky ruffian as Pedro, and was too
honourable to resort to secret means of getting rid
of him.  Failing with Ignez herself, he disdained
to apply for the intervention of her father's authority,
and yet he saw daily, yea, hourly, how, misled by
her imagination alone, the heart of his beautiful
cousin was being corrupted, warped and turned
from him.
</p>

<p>
"Why is this?&mdash;how is this?&mdash;answer me,
Ignez?" he once asked her, imploringly.
</p>

<p>
"He saved me," said she, with her sweet face
half averted from him, "when you left me to
perish."
</p>

<p>
"Ignez!" exclaimed the young man, in a voice of
shame and agony.
</p>

<p>
"It is true, cousin Perez."
</p>

<p>
"I cannot swim&mdash;I have told you so a hundred
times."
</p>

<p>
"Then you should learn, my poor Perez."
</p>

<p>
"I could but shout for succour."
</p>

<p>
"And <i>he</i> came!" she said, with heaving breast
and flashing eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Unless assisted by Heaven, I could not have
saved you, dear, dear Ignez," said he, almost in
tears.
</p>

<p>
"Then you should have perished with me, if you
loved me."
</p>

<p>
"<i>If I loved you!</i>" he repeated, in sorrowful
reproach; "but what need was there for perishing,
when I saw succour coming?"
</p>

<p>
"You saw him&mdash;you saw him who saved me,"
continued the pitiless little beauty, with each reply
planting an arrow in the heart of poor Perez.
</p>

<p>
"He saved you for the bribe of a thousand
dollars!" said he, scornfully; "all on the mole
heard that plain enough."
</p>

<p>
"In vain do you enviously seek to detract from
him, cousin Perez.  He saved me for myself&mdash;perhaps
for himself too," was the still more cutting
rejoinder.
</p>

<p>
"Enough, Senora de Moreno," said Perez, in a
towering passion; "I shall yet unmask this
piccaroon&mdash;this wretched impostor, if to do so should
cost me half my fortune!"
</p>

<p>
As Perez uttered this threat, and retired by one
door of the drawing-room, it chanced that the
redoubtable and interesting Don Pedro Florez de
Serrano entered by another, and these words, which
he heard distinctly enough, made that worthy
cavalier feel very much as if in a Californian vapour
bath&mdash;the hottest of such contrivances; and he
felt, moreover, there was no time to be lost in
getting rid of Don Perez, and bringing matters to
issue with Ignez de Moreno.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><br />
THE DRESSING-CLOSET OF IGNEZ.
</h3>

<p>
During these proceedings, Don Perez had many
conferences with the two priests.
</p>

<p>
Padre Eizagiuerro, the confessor of Ignez,
suspected much, but Padre Ugarte, a stern and ascetic
enthusiast, suspected, and said more; for he openly
inveighed against the simplicity of Don Salvador,
in believing all the fine things Pedro said about his
relations in Spain, and his ample possessions on the
table land of Anahuac, as contrasted with his
cupidity on the mole, before he would consent to
save the drowning girl's life.
</p>

<p>
"A seaman! he&mdash;a Confederate officer! was such
the conduct of either?" exclaimed the Nuncio.
</p>

<p>
"But he refused, my dear padre, he flatly refused
to receive the 2,000 dollars!" urged Moreno, who
was too simple and too full of gratitude to suspect
Pedro.
</p>

<p>
"Refuse&mdash;ha! ha!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"Acting all&mdash;acting all!" said Ugarte, a sharp
observer of men and things.
</p>

<p>
"But for him, I should to-night have been a poor
old childless man," replied Moreno.
</p>

<p>
Perez and they employed an escribano, who had
correspondents in various quarters, and ere long
he gathered strange tidings of Pedro.  The bishop
of Orizaba and the <i>escribano</i>, who had been robbed
in the Barranca Secca, the mate of the otter-hunter,
Hawkshaw, and the keeper of the Posada De San
Augustin, with others, were all written to&mdash;the
strands of evidence being untwisted as a lawyer alone
could discover and untwist them; telegraph and
railway appliances were all at work; and thus, all
unknown to Pedro and Zuares, who were already
under the surveillance of the alguazils, a network of
evidence was closing round them.
</p>

<p>
The day had been mild and warm for December&mdash;February
being the hottest month of the year at
Santiago&mdash;and Donna Ignez had retired early to
her own apartments.  All day she had been busy
with Donna Erminia, little Donna Paula, and other
ladies, in preparing artificial flowers and lanterns
for the grand religious festival, which was to be held
in the Church of La Campagnia, wherein the Padre
Ugarte and Eizagiuerra, the Nuncio, were to officiate,
a festival which was looked forward to with the
deepest interest by all in Santiago.
</p>

<p>
Seated before the mirror, with all her fine dark hair
floating in rippling masses upon her smooth white
shoulders, the girl was lingering, ere she proceeded
further to undress, and seemed disposed to muse,
and to gaze at the reflection of her own charming
figure, while she repeated, re-acted, and reconsidered
with a soft, dreamy smile on her lips and in her eyes,
all that had passed of late between herself and
Pedro; and to think, with a sigh, of what her papa's
views might be, when he came to hear that their
visitor had adopted the character of an avowed
lover&mdash;that she was on bad terms with cousin Perez,
had well-nigh quarrelled with him, and dismissed
him!
</p>

<p>
These thoughts rather agitated the little beauty,
and so immersed was she in them that she did not
hear a light step on the gilded balcony outside her
window, which was yet partly unclosed, nor did she
hear the sash pushed open, as a man cautiously
entered her apartment, and stood for a minute
surveying her with an expression of admiration, that on
this occasion was in no way feigned.
</p>

<p>
This nocturnal visitor was no other than Pedro,
who, in the course of casual conversation, had
cunningly discovered from Ignez the locality of her
sleeping-place, and who, after supping with Don
Salvador, had taken an additional bottle of wine at
a taberna with Zuares, and returned to the house on
the Alameda.  Then, selecting the window of Ignez,
he had cast his lasso over the balcony and swung
himself up, hand over hand, in a manner which his
past nautical experiences rendered easy enough.
</p>

<p>
He approached slowly and stealthily, dreading an
outcry when she discovered him.  He had but two
ideas.  One was to persuade her to elope with him;
the other was the hope that she might so far
compromise herself that marriage alone could save her
honour.  Cautious in all his proceedings, he had
gathered the lasso in his hand, for to leave it
dangling into the street might have attracted attention,
and caused premature discovery.  Behind one of
the poplars in the Alameda, Zuares sat crouching on
his hams, and watching like a lynx.
</p>

<p>
Pedro was within a pace of Ignez when she
started, and her dark eyes dilated as she saw his
form appear behind her own, reflected in the
mirror; but, ere a cry could escape her parting
lips, he threw his arms around her, and stifled it
with a kiss.
</p>

<p>
"Pedro&mdash;Don Pedro!" she exclaimed, in a voice
of agitation and terror.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Ignez, 'tis I!  <i>Nina mi alma</i>&mdash;'tis I."
</p>

<p>
This forecastle phrase, which means literally, "my
little honey," by no means reassured her.
</p>

<p>
"How&mdash;what does this mean?" she asked, angrily.
</p>

<p>
"It means that&mdash;that my love, Ignez, can neither
tolerate absence nor delay."
</p>

<p>
"Delay!" she faltered, while gathering up her
hair, by which she displayed a very taper waist, and
two polished elbows.
</p>

<p>
"I dread alike the wiles and enmity of your cousin
Perez, and that devil of a Padre Eizagiuerro, with
many others who dislike me, and I have come hither
to-night that we may be separated no more."
</p>

<p>
"What am I to understand by all this, senor?"
asked the girl, with increasing agitation.
</p>

<p>
"Does not your own heart tell you?" asked
Pedro, embracing her.
</p>

<p>
"<i>O madre de Dios</i>&mdash;what is all this I hear?" she
exclaimed, while flushing and palpitating in his
arms, and glancing nervously at the door.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Demonio</i>&mdash;I forget what I am about!" muttered
Pedro, as he hastened to the door, and softly turned
the key.
</p>

<p>
"Leave me&mdash;retire as you came.  Leave me, if
you hope for pardon&mdash;if you would not wish to see
me die at your feet, Don Pedro," said Ignez, gathering
her energies, and gazing at him with a glance
which was very loving and imploring, though there
was something in Pedro's aspect now, flushed as he
was with wine and presumptuous hopes, that almost
terrified her; for his features seemed unusually
coarse and swollen, and his eyes wore a very wild
expression.  "Leave me," she repeated, "or I shall
be compelled to cry for aid; my father's room is not
very far from this."
</p>

<p>
Pedro laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Senora," said he, "you forget that your reputation
is at stake if you utter an outcry, and I am thus
discovered&mdash;so kiss me, and be quiet, will you?
Were it known that a man was in your bed-room,
even for ten minutes, all Santiago would ring with
it to-morrow; and think of the fuss there would be
about it on the Alameda.  How the Padre
Eizagiuerro would raise his eyebrows, and the Padre
Ugarte his voice; how Donna Erminia would shrug
her white shoulders; and what would old papa
Salvador de Moreno say of it?  So, my little beauty,
my darling Ignez, be quiet pray, for all our sakes.
Come, <i>mi queredita</i>, sit on my knee, and I shall soon
teach you to love me with all your heart."
</p>

<p>
But Pedro's words&mdash;the very picture of shame
and exposure which his banter unwittingly
portrayed&mdash;instead of answering his purpose, fully
recalled the young lady to herself, and a sense of
her danger.
</p>

<p>
The regard she bore him in her impulsive breast
first filled her eyes with tears of sorrow, that he
should dare to act thus, and then they flashed with
indignation that Pedro should conceive a scheme so
disastrous.
</p>

<p>
"If you love me, as you say, Don Pedro, I beseech
you to retire," she said, sternly.
</p>

<p>
"It is because I do love you as I say, that I am
here," urged Pedro, making another effort to clasp
her in his arms.
</p>

<p>
But she eluded him, and in a voice there was no
mistaking&mdash;low, subdued, and full of angry
determination, she replied:
</p>

<p>
"Begone, senor, or by the soul of my mother, I
shall summon my father, and he always sleeps with
fire-arms at hand."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Demonio!</i> what a little spitfire it is."
</p>

<p>
At that moment there was a loud knock on the
chamber-door.
</p>

<p>
"Who is there?" asked Ignez, growing deadly
pale, and sickening with the thought of the false
position in which Pedro had placed her.
</p>

<p>
"Open, Ignez," said the voice of Don Salvador,
"'Tis I, your father."
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter, senor?" asked Ignez,
almost sinking with distress.
</p>

<p>
"A man has been seen to enter the house!"
</p>

<p>
"A man!"
</p>

<p>
"So your cousin Perez tells me."  At this name
Pedro ground his teeth, and felt for his knife.
</p>

<p>
"We have searched for him everywhere, save
here, and we must assure ourselves that your rooms
are safe; open."
</p>

<p>
"In one moment, dearest papa," replied Ignez,
pointing to the window, pale and trembling, her
dark eyes flashing, her curved nostrils quivering;
but instead of retiring as he had entered, Pedro
snatched up his lasso, darted into a little closet, the
door of which was open, and concealed himself
among the cloaks, dresses, and other garments, which
hung from pegs upon the wall.
</p>

<p>
This was the bath-room of Ignez, and a <i>brazero</i> of
lighted charcoal was smouldering on the floor.  This
seriously incommoded Pedro, who remained
ensconced in the little apartment, bitterly repenting
the whole adventure, by which his safety was
compromised, and his hopes, perhaps, dashed for ever.
So he crouched and listened, with his hand on the
haft of his knife, ready to spring forth and kill Don
Salvador&mdash;even Ignez herself, if it were necessary&mdash;for
whenever he was at bay, or caught in his own
toils, the cruel impulses of his savage heart gained
their fullest sway.
</p>

<p>
"I have heard or seen nothing to cause alarm,
papa," said Ignez, whose colourless face was closely
scanned by Don Perez, as he looked round the
apartment and over the balcony.
</p>

<p>
"It is very odd," said Don Salvador; "but as
Perez passed homeward he saw a man enter the
house.  I will report the affair to the alguazil-mayor,
for we have searched everywhere, and can find no
trace of the fellow.  I am sorry we have disturbed
you, my child, when weary, as you must be with
your day's work at La Campagnia," he added, while
half-cocking his pistols.  "But good-night, darling,
and pleasant dreams to you."
</p>

<p>
"We have not searched this closet," said Perez,
whose pallor exceeded that of Inez, and her heart
seemed to die within her, as he opened the
dressing-room door.  "Faugh!" he added, "such a smell of
charcoal.  My dear Ignez, you should be careful
with that <i>brazero</i>."
</p>

<p>
He then locked the door.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Perez," said old Moreno, "Ignez looks pale."
</p>

<p>
"May I speak with her for one minute, my dear
senor, and will you wait for me in the billiard-room?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly, my dear boy; but don't stay long,"
said the old gentleman, as he smilingly retired.
</p>

<p>
Ignez gazed anxiously, almost with a haggard
aspect, at her cousin, and then her eyes wandered
furtively towards the door of the fatal closet.
</p>

<p>
"Ignez," said Perez, trembling in spite of himself.
</p>

<p>
"Cousin!"
</p>

<p>
"There is a man in that closet."
</p>

<p>
Her dismay was now overwhelming, for it was
combined with a shame and terror against which
even her pure innocence failed to support her.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Perez, my cousin, dare you accuse&mdash;dare
you suspect&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I suspect and accuse you of nothing.  Oh Ignez!
God forbid, though I have suffered much of late.
But a villain whom I do suspect has concealed
himself for some nefarious purpose in your
dressing-closet.  On looking in I saw his feet, and he must
be got rid of quietly, for not a breath must stain the
reputation of you, my dearest Ignez.  Leave me to
act," continued Perez, as he opened the closet door
and cocked a pistol.  "Come forth," said he; "you
are discovered, Don Pedro.  Come forth instantly,
and in silence too."
</p>

<p>
There was no reply, but the body of Pedro was
seen extended at length on the floor!  He was in a
state of exhaustion&mdash;overcome by his recent
potations at the <i>taberno</i>, combined with the noxious
fumes of the charcoal from the brazero.
</p>

<p>
Perez kicked him with his foot, and smiled grimly.
</p>

<p>
"I told you, my dear cousin, to be careful with
that <i>brazero</i>.  Luckily there is no moon, the night
is cloudy, and this carrion may recover his senses
in the cool Alameda."
</p>

<p>
Pale as death, bewildered and terrified, Ignez
gazed on the prostrate figure, and on those features
which seemed to be convulsed by the throes of
death.
</p>

<p>
Don Perez tied the lasso under the arms of Pedro,
and dragging his body to the balcony, after carefully
ascertaining that there was no one in the street,
with no small exertion (for the lad was slight though
wiry) he hoisted the bulky intruder over the iron
railing, and lowered him to the ground&mdash;not very
tenderly, perhaps.  He then dropped the lasso after
its proprietor, carefully closed and secured the
window-sashes, kissed his passive cousin, and
bidding her good night, retired.
</p>

<p>
At that moment the great bell of the church of
La Campagnia (which was already beginning to be
lighted up with its countless lamps, for the great
festival of the morrow) tolled the hour of twelve.
Every stroke sounded like a knell in the soul of
Ignez, and she burst into tears.
</p>

<p>
She was guiltless, and he had not suspected her;
yet in her innocent heart she felt terrified like one
who unwittingly has committed a great crime.  Oh,
that Padre Eizagiuerro were here, that she might
confide it all to him, and solicit his advice!
</p>

<p>
Was that the man who had so lately poured his
daring love speeches into her ears, and who had
striven to embrace her&mdash;he whom she had seen
Perez dragging forth, with an air of such mingled
anger and satisfaction&mdash;dying or dead?
</p>

<p>
She dared not peep forth to satisfy the curiosity
that consumed her.  Had she done so, about one
hour after Pedro was lowered over the balcony, she
might have seen him walking slowly away, leaning
on the arm of Zuares.
</p>

<p>
The cool night breeze in the open Alameda had
revived him; but the fumes of the brazero in that
little closet were nearly being the means of cutting
short the career of Pedro Barradas, and so saving
us, and many others, a vast deal of trouble.
</p>

<p>
On this night, the sleep of Ignez was far from
being a peaceful one.
</p>

<p>
Perez slept like a dormouse.  He was happy, and
his first thought in the morning was to open sundry
letters and telegrams from Valparaiso.
</p>

<p>
"Oho, Don Pedro Florez de Serrano!" he
exclaimed, "lieutenant of the <i>Florida</i>, in the naval
service of the States, on his parole of honour, cousin
of the Captain-General of Cuba, nephew of the
Corregidor of Ciudad Rodrigo, student of
Salamanca, and the devil only knows all what more, so
we have caught you, have we?  <i>Bueno viva!</i>"
</p>

<p>
And the young man, as he drank his coffee and
lit a cigar, laughed loudly.
</p>

<p>
How little could he foresee the awful events of
the night that were to follow!
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap17"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><br />
THE GREAT CRIME OF PEDRO BARRADAS.
</h3>

<p>
In the cool night breeze, that swept through the
Alameda de la Canada, Pedro had recovered
consciousness, but he had no conception of how he
came to be there, nor had he a recollection of
anything that had occurred after he darted into the
dressing-closet of Ignez.  He could remember that
an overpowering sleep fell upon him, and that
was all.
</p>

<p>
During the day he was too unwell to visit the
house of the Morenos; but he hoped to meet Donna
Ignez, with the rest of her family, at the great
festival in the Church of La Campagnia, when,
doubtless, she would be able to explain all to him.
</p>

<p>
"You are sure that matters are all right with
this girl?" asked Zuares, doubtfully, for he had
seen a man lowering what he at first supposed to
be his brother's dead body over the balcony.
</p>

<p>
"Right&mdash;of course.  <i>Vamos!</i> it is a clear case
with her now."
</p>

<p>
"Clear case of what?"
</p>

<p>
"Of going into consumption, or into a convent, if
she does not marry me," replied Pedro, who,
however, was not without some unpleasant doubts
himself, when remembering the unconcealed anger and
vexation exhibited by Ignez last night; "but,
Zuares, do you know that this old fellow&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Who?"
</p>

<p>
"Don Salvador de Moreno&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Well?"
</p>

<p>
"Possesses one of the thirty-four gold mines in
the Curacy of Colina, with one of the <i>laverados</i> on
the mountain of Giundo?"
</p>

<p>
"Is it a bath?" asked Zuares.
</p>

<p>
"No, you fool!" replied Pedro, angrily.
</p>

<p>
"'Whoso calleth his brother a fool&mdash;&mdash;'"
</p>

<p>
"'Is in danger of hell-fire!'  Bah!  I learnt all
that long ago at Orizaba."
</p>

<p>
"Well&mdash;and this <i>laverado</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Is a place where the gold-dust is washed from
the sand.  Ignez shall be heiress of as many pistoles
as would fill yonder brigantine to the beams."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Bueno!</i> then we shall see what we shall see.  I
am beginning to tire of this kind of life, and long
for salt-water again."
</p>

<p>
The night of the 8th December drew on, and
Pedro, with his brother, were among the first who
repaired to the Plazuela de la Campagnia.  Long
before the doors of the vast church were open,
hundreds of splendid carriages, rolling from all
quarters of the city, deposited ladies in rich
summer dresses and ample crinolines&mdash;large beyond any
that we see in Europe&mdash;at the high-arched portal,
through which, and through every window of that
lofty pile, there glared a marvellous blaze of light,
for the edifice had been illuminated with a
splendour never seen before.  Consequently the
excitement in Santiago was great, and great was
the competition among the wealthy and well-born
to procure admission.
</p>

<p>
It was the great festival of the Immaculate
Conception, and more than 20,000 lights and lamps, of
every brilliant colour, mostly camphine, garlanded
the pillars, encircled the arches, lined the
cornices, or were festooned across the great church,
and so many coloured globes were used on this
occasion, that the whole interior resembled a hall
of dazzling fire.  All was light and radiance&mdash;there
could be no shadow anywhere.
</p>

<p>
The great altar was a veritable pyramid of light,
amid which there shone a marvellous image of the
Madonna, copied from Murillo's famous picture.
Her eyes were turned to heaven, her hands were
crossed upon her breast; her feet were placed upon
a crescent moon, and clouds of snow-white gauze
and muslin seemed to float around her.
</p>

<p>
Never had such a display been witnessed in this
old church of the Jesuits (since the marriage of the
Conde de Sierra Bella, whose palace yet stands in
the great plaza), for old it was, when compared with
other buildings in the city, having been founded in
the early part of the seventeenth century.
</p>

<p>
From the floor the altar rose to the roof of the
church, and as it did not reach from wall to wall,
on each side were great reliquaries, closed by doors
so richly gilded, that they shone like two vast plates
of polished gold.
</p>

<p>
All on their knees before it knelt a congregation
composed of 2,000 women (and a few hundred
men), all richly attired, and many of them young,
noble, and beautiful.  It was a sight such as never
before had been witnessed in Santiago.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to the favour of the Nuncio, Donna Ignez,
with her cousin, Don Perez, and his sisters, Donna
Erminia and the little Donna Paula, had procured
places close to the glittering rail which surrounded
the vast altar, and there they were speedily joined
by Pedro, who left his brother among the valets in
livery at the church porch, and who, utterly
indifferent to, or oblivious of the long stare and
steady frown bestowed upon him by Don Perez,
presented his hand to Ignez, and&mdash;after he had
devoutly crossed himself, and smote his breast
sundry times&mdash;prepared to join in a whispered
conversation, for the service had not yet commenced.
</p>

<p>
During the livelong day an idea that he was dead&mdash;that
he had been suffocated in the closet&mdash;had
haunted the mind of Ignez, who felt herself as if an
accomplice in a great crime, and thus, when she
found him kneeling beside her in church, she gave
him her daintily-gloved little hand with a bright
smile, that was full of real happiness; for though
this man had so nearly destroyed her honour, she
was most thankful to Heaven that he had not
perished, as her fears predicted.
</p>

<p>
She felt no love for him now, but sincere gratitude
to faithful cousin Perez, and returning love, too;
but Pedro construed her smile in his own fashion,
and believing that his fortunes were still in a fair
way to prosper, he continued to whisper and kneel
by her side, greatly to the rage of Perez, of whose
agency in the episode of last night the bold impostor
was yet completely ignorant.
</p>

<p>
Padre Ugarte was to preach, and Padre Eizagiuerro,
the Apostolic Nuncio, the friend of Pope Pius IX.,
and founder of the American College at Rome, was
next to address the people.
</p>

<p>
It had been said all over Santiago, some days
before, that in the house of the Morenos, the Nuncio
had expressed a regret that too probably the lighting
up of the Campagnia Church would be inferior to
the illuminations of the Romans.
</p>

<p>
"Rome!" exclaimed Ugarte; "in Colina we
have four-and-thirty mines of gold; in Lampa
three of silver; the mountains of Caren are full of
gold, and gold laverados cover all the summit of
Calen.  Our devotees are rich, Senor Nuncio, and
on that holy night I shall show you <i>such an
illumination as the world has never seen</i>!"
</p>

<p>
Fearfully prophetic was the boast of Ugarte!
</p>

<p>
While the people were still absorbed in prayer,
and many a bright eye, and many a young and
beautiful face turned in wonder and pleasure to the
countless lamps that covered all the church, and ere
the choir had struck up, or the procession of
ecclesiastics entered, Pedro saw his brother Zuares
forcing a passage, without much ceremony, through
the kneeling thousands, towards him.  What did
this portend?
</p>

<p>
Pedro first felt emotions of annoyance, then of
alarm, for the face of Zuares, who beckoned to him,
was pale with agitation.  Pedro approached him by
a few paces.
</p>

<p>
"We are lost!  They have discovered everything!"
said Zuares, in a breathless whisper.
</p>

<p>
"They&mdash;who?"
</p>

<p>
"In the porch of the church I heard our names
mentioned, and so concealed myself behind a statue
to listen."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well!  Quick, quick!"
</p>

<p>
"There, now in close consultation about the best
mode of seizing you as you leave the church, are
Don Salvador de Moreno, Felipe Fernandez, the
keeper of the Posada de Augustin, the mate of the
brigantine, and that accursed Englishman,
Hawkshaw.  They have with them the alguazil-mayor,
and four horse-police, with their carbines, and I
heard them all whispering of sacrilege&mdash;robbery."
</p>

<p>
"What more?" hissed Pedro, through his
clenched teeth.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Murder!</i>" whispered Zuares, with pallid lips.
</p>

<p>
The "trail of the serpent" was complete.
</p>

<p>
"The door is watched, you say?"
</p>

<p>
"And the church is surrounded by horse and foot
alguazils," replied Zuares, in the same low, hurried
whisper.
</p>

<p>
Pedro glanced hastily about him; there seemed
to be no way of escape but by the porch, and that
was guarded.  Don Perez had seen Zuares approach,
and his keen, stern eye was on the brothers.
Already he was rising as if to leave the church;
some plan for escape must be decided on, and
quickly, as if the great fiend had whispered it, a
diabolical thought occurred to Pedro Barradas.
</p>

<p>
He glanced towards the magnificent altar, on
which, amid thousands of waxen and feather flowers,
there burned several hundred lights.  It was a
transparent tabernacle, within which were
innumerable jets of liquid gas, and it was composed
entirely of woodwork with gilded pasteboard and
draperies of muslin.
</p>

<p>
Pedro resolved to create an alarm, and attempt
an escape while it lasted.
</p>

<p>
Just at that moment, when the Nuncio and Ugarte,
preceded by boys bearing censers and tapers, were
entering, just as the choir struck up, and while a
solemn murmur pervaded the vast church, for the
crescent moon beneath the feet of the Madonna
suddenly flashed forth a silvery splendour, unseen
by all, save Don Perez, who was retiring, Pedro
threw a lighted cigar match among the draperies of
the altar, and in a moment the light festoons and
muslin clouds, the whole figure of the Madonna, and
the altar, which was seventy feet in height, became
a roaring pyramid of fire.
</p>

<p>
A wild cry from the kneeling congregation burst
over the whole church, and the door instantly
became blocked by fugitives, who fell, wedged over
each other in a hopeless pile, the upper stifling
those below, while the spread of the conflagration
exceeded in its speed the fear of those who would
have fled.
</p>

<p>
An effect was produced beyond what Pedro had
anticipated.  He hoped for a mere alarm, he produced
a catastrophe beyond all parallel in ancient or
modern times.
</p>

<p>
Maddened, however, by double terror, he was
among the first who sought for safety.  Trampling
women and children under foot and endued with
twice his natural strength and activity by sheer
desperation, he contrived to reach the sill of a
window, by climbing over a tomb, and dashing the
lozenged frame to pieces, was preparing to throw
himself headlong out, when his foot was seized
from below.
</p>

<p>
He uttered an angry imprecation and looked down.
</p>

<p>
Donna Ignez and little Donna Paula both clung
to him in the wildest terror.
</p>

<p>
"Save us, Don Pedro&mdash;save us, for the love of
God!" cried they in despair, for the whole of that
fated church was now covered with sheets of flame,
its twenty thousand camphine lamps, as their cords
and festoons gave way, adding to the terror by
descending like a rain of fire, and setting aflame the
hair and light summer dresses of those below&mdash;that
struggling mass of horror-stricken people, who were
all hopelessly wreathed and wedged together.
</p>

<p>
It was fire&mdash;fire&mdash;fire everywhere&mdash;above, below,
around&mdash;a seething mass of flaming figures, wavering
and scorching, a rising and descending sea of
red flame, for the church of God had now become a
living hell!
</p>

<p>
"Save me! save me!" gasped Ignez, choking
in the heat, as her light summer dress caught fire.
</p>

<p>
"No use to save her now from fire, as I did from
water.  Perez, you don't require to swim here,"
cried the barbarian, as he thrust the shrieking girl
and little Paula among the flames with his foot,
and, springing into the street without, fled from
Santiago.
</p>

<p>
The public papers have told us how, in less than
a quarter of an hour, nearly all who were in that
fatal church&mdash;that stupendous holocaust&mdash;to the
number of nearly 3,000, perished; how a phalanx
of death choked up the porch, and how, in many
instances, tender hands and delicate arms were
wrenched, yea, literally torn off, in attempts to drag
forth the dying; how whole families were reduced
to cinders, side by side, and all in the lapse of a few
minutes.
</p>

<p>
They also told us "how the voice of lamentation
was heard all over the land, and the bitter weeping
of fathers, of husbands, and lovers for those who
were the joy and brightness of their life, that
refuses to be comforted because they are not.
Hundreds of young girls, only yesterday radiant
and beautiful, in the luxuriant bloom of the fresh
and hopeful spring of life, to-day calcined, hideous
corpses, horrible, loathsome to the sight, and
impossible to be recognised!  Within that quarter of an
hour 2,000 souls had passed through the ordeal of
fire to the judgment-seat of God!"
</p>

<p>
Old Don Salvador de Moreno made frenzied
efforts to pierce through the pile of maddened and
suffocating women, who hopelessly blocked up the
door of the church, seeking to see, to save if he
could, his daughter&mdash;his only child.
</p>

<p>
The screaming, the wringing of hands, the tearing
of hair, and beating of faces, the invocations of the
dying, and the roar of the advancing flames within
and beyond, imparting to the church portal an
appearance like to the entrance of a vast furnace,
seared his heart and his eyeballs.
</p>

<p>
He saw not his daughter; but, amid this most
unearthly blaze, he could distinguish Donna
Erminia, and knew that Ignez could not be far off.
He could see the tall, fair-skinned, proud, and
beautiful Erminia, and little Paula, with her hair
dishevelled, like many others near her, undergo a
sudden and horrible transformation, as the lurid
flame seized upon their skirts and tresses.
</p>

<p>
The sheet of scorching fire passed over them!
</p>

<p>
They became blackened, lean, shrunken, rigid,
dead, sable statues, in contorted attitudes, and then
crumbled away amid the furnace, for such had the
church become.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a figure rose for an instant amid the
mass.  It was Perez&mdash;Perez with Ignez in his arms,
and as he rose her father saw them&mdash;his hair and
her dress all ablaze; then both sank back into that
red sea of fire, to rise no more!
</p>

<p>
The old man became senseless, and was borne out
of the press by the alguazil-mayor and Cramply
Hawkshaw.
</p>

<p>
The Chilian papers tell us that a horseman threw
his lasso into the church where a hundred hands
tried to catch it.  This man was Felipe Fernandez,
of Valparaiso, who by main strength dragged one
woman out in flames.
</p>

<p>
Again he cast his lasso in, but the fire scorched
the leather thong away.
</p>

<p>
Within the time we have stated&mdash;a brief quarter
of an hour&mdash;the roof, the dome, and cupola,
descended in flames, with a thundering crash upon
the church below, and all was over!
</p>

<p>
There perished all the family of Moreno, and
their remains were never recognised.  So poor
Perez, whom Ignez had taunted for not saving her
when in the water, died by her side in that sea of
flame!
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * *
</p>

<p>
The silence of the grave succeeded to the cries of
despair that for a time had pierced the calm night
air, and, as the flames smouldered and died away on
the sloped strata of blackened corpses that lay
beneath the fallen dome, those who looked fearfully
through the windows could see, by the clear
splendour of the tropical moon, those thousands of
calcined dead, kneeling, standing, or lying all in their
last contorted posture, as the wasting fire, or the
agony of their awful end, had left them.
</p>

<p>
For the remainder of that night, no sounds were
heard in Santiago but those of lamentation, and the
solemn tolling of the church bells, as the archbishop
summoned all to prayer for the souls that were
gone.
</p>

<p>
Zuares was one of those men who effected an
escape by the sacristy-door, before it was blocked
up by fugitives, and meeting his brother on the
road that led to the mountains, they heard the
live-long night the tolling of the city bells in the
distance.
</p>

<p>
Even they were overcome by dread and horror, as
they continued their flight in silence and desperation,
where they knew not and cared not, so that
they left the city of Santiago as far behind them as
possible.
</p>

<p>
For days after this they lurked unseen, unknown,
and safely, in a great cane-brake, among the
feathery bamboos&mdash;the <i>guádua</i>&mdash;some of which are
ninety feet in height.
</p>

<p>
Ere long they reached the sea-coast, and shipped
on board a short-handed brig that lay at the mouth
of the Maypo river, laden with guano, and bound
for Britain, and they gladly looked forward to face
again even the nights of bitter snow and
close-reefed foresails off Cape Horn.
</p>

<p>
This vessel they left, when paid off in the London
Docks, and, to the misfortune of all concerned, were
shipped on board the <i>Hermione</i> by Captain Phillips,
who could little foresee the mischief they had in
store for him and his friends.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><br />
COMMITTED TO THE DEEP.
</h3>

<p>
The <i>Diaria de Valparaiso</i>, <i>El Mercurio del Vapor</i>,
and other papers, but chiefly documents of a private
nature belonging to the late Don Salvador de Moreno
(for the poor man did not long survive that terrible
8th of December), have assisted us in the compilation
of the foregoing narrative of the two brothers,
which forms a singular sequel to their father's secret
history; but until the fact fell from the baked and
faltering lips of Pedro Barradas, in no way were
Morley Ashton, Bartelot, Heriot, and others who
listened, prepared to hear that he was concerned in
bringing about a catastrophe so terrible as that
which closes our preceding chapter.
</p>

<p>
"So that was the great crime of Pedro&mdash;the awful
deed which he has so frequently referred to in his
ravings," said Morley.
</p>

<p>
"An awful deed truly," added Captain Phillips.
"Who would live, even if he could, haunted by such
memories?  A precious logbook of crime his life
presents?"
</p>

<p>
Death, however, came on Pedro fast.  One of his
last acts was to examine his wretched pallet for the
watch and ring which, as detailed in a previous
chapter, he had forcibly taken from Hawkshaw.
</p>

<p>
His half-fatuous intention was now, probably, to
bestow them on some one; but a groan of pity and
disgust escaped him on finding that one of his
worthless compatriots had already abstracted them, and
now, perhaps, would gladly give them both for one
drop of water to cool his parched tongue in the
drifting quarter-boat.
</p>

<p>
"The past, the past!" he moaned; "<i>misericordia! misericordia</i>!
My life&mdash;my lost life!  Oh! that
with my present bitter experience I could live it
over once again&mdash;even a year of it&mdash;how different it
should be!  How many have been misspent, frittered
away and blackened?  Oh! for a month&mdash;a week&mdash;to
repent.  One day&mdash;mother of God&mdash;only one
day; but it may not be&mdash;cannot be!  Oh that I
might warn Zuares, ere it be too late also for
him&mdash;no absolution, no hope."
</p>

<p>
As the life of Pedro ebbed&mdash;easily, however,
complete mortification having set in&mdash;and his senses
passed away, he muttered something again and
again; and Morley, who was in the forecastle, held
the lamp near&mdash;for night had come on&mdash;and stooped
over him to listen.
</p>

<p>
He was delirious as well as dying, and his husky
and broken ravings were of the cathedral church of
Orizaba, and he averred that he saw at the foot of
his bed, in that wretched forecastle bunk, the figure
of a woman.
</p>

<p>
"A figure&mdash;what is it like?" asked Morley,
glancing round in spite of himself.
</p>

<p>
"A woman enshrined in light.  She is clad in
blue, with thirteen stars around her head.  <i>Ave
Maria purissima!  Ave Maria purissima!</i>" he cried,
and, sinking back, closed his eyes, overcome by
weakness and excitement.
</p>

<p>
It was the image so revered in his innocent
childhood, when he and Zuares prayed at their mother's
knee; and with this shadow before his visionary
eye&mdash;the same figure that in dreams had hung over
his cradle in infancy&mdash;the feet of which he and
Zuares had been taught to kiss&mdash;the same image,
with an aureole of light around its placid face, the
Madonna of Orizaba, with her feet resting on the
sharp, pale crescent moon, before his glazing eyes,
whose last expression was fear and ecstasy&mdash;the
soul of this inscrutable ruffian passed away!
</p>

<p>
Then Morley Ashton, who was the last lonely
watcher, hastened on deck to report that all was
over.
</p>

<p>
This perpetrator of so many crimes was dead!
Ferocity, avarice, cruelty, insatiate lust, unavailing
remorse, and all the stormy passions which had, in
turn, convulsed that lawless heart, that dark and
sombre visage, were gone now.  The man was dead
and gone&mdash;gone as if he had never been!
</p>

<p>
Before the ship's bell had clanged the last half
hour of the morning watch, Noah and Morrison had
rolled his body up in the blankets in which he died,
and had lashed a couple of shot in a canvas-bag to
his ankles.
</p>

<p>
Then they laid him on a grating to leeward,
anxious to have the last rites over before the young
ladies came on deck.
</p>

<p>
The red enamelled cross of San Jago, which
Morley had brought from the hermit's cell, was tied
up with him; indeed, it was found impossible to
take it from his hand, in which it was tightly
clenched.
</p>

<p>
There was mental relief to all on board when the
burial of Pedro&mdash;the last act of a long and gloomy
drama&mdash;was over, and when his tall and muscular
form&mdash;herculean and ghastly it looked, rolled up in
blankets, and lashed round with spunyarn&mdash;went
surging, feet foremost, through the white foam,
vanishing for ever, in the deep green sea to leeward,
while the ship, as if lightened of a load, flew through
the shining waves of the Mozambique.
</p>

<p>
This was on a Saturday, about 8 A.M., when
the golden sun shone in all its beauty on the fresh,
cool morning sea.
</p>

<p>
Ethel could never think of Pedro without a cold
shudder, and often said, "Thus is sin its own
punishment;" but Rose, her terror past, had
imbibed almost a sentimental pity or sympathy for
the dead ruffian, who figured so largely in the diary
before mentioned, which was now resumed for the
benefit of her old gossip and companion, Lucy Page,
at Acton-Rennel.
</p>

<p>
Captain Phillips, however, took a very different
view of the matter, and so much had his naturally
kind character been soured or warped by recent
events, that he could scarcely be prevailed upon to
read the burial service over the defunct mutineer;
and thus he cut it pretty short, upon the plea that a
rough day was before them, that he had few hands,
and wished to take in a reef in each of the courses;
so never were those words&mdash;so solemn and so
awful&mdash;under the usual circumstances "we thus commit
his body to the deep," so irreverently uttered, and
yet, worthy old Jack Phillips is the kindest of all
good fellows.
</p>

<p>
The Saturday night came on, calm, clear, and
starry, the south-west monsoon blew fresh and
steadily, and as close-hauled as a square-rigged craft
could be, the <i>Hermione</i> was making a long tack
towards the southern point of Madagascar.  Fortunately,
nothing had been seen yet of the three red
proas, of which such earnest warning had been
given by the officer of Her Majesty's corvette
the <i>Clyde</i>.
</p>

<p>
The cheerful glass went round to "sweethearts
and wives," and to "all ships at sea."  To these
weekly toasts, Captain Phillips added a special glass
of stiff grog, in honour of his airy friend, "the
clerk of the weather," whom Rose, who was writing,
supposed to be the late Admiral Fitzroy.  Ethel was
occupying herself with crochet, Mr. Basset was
asleep, and Morley was at the wheel on deck, and
already it seemed that Pedro Barradas and the
particulars of his terrible history were forgotten.  So&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><br />
DR. HERIOT'S FEE.
</h3>

<p>
During the six preceding chapters, the reader may
have been kindly wondering how Mr. Basset's health
progressed after the night which succeeded the
skilful attempt of Dr. Heriot to rescue him from a
death that seemed all but accomplished.
</p>

<p>
That night he had passed in heavy groans, in
nervous startings, and uneasy slumber; but next
morning he was able to articulate, and complained
to Ethel, in accents faint and weak as those of an
ailing child, of pains that spread over all his body;
these, however, were only consequent to the severe
friction he had undergone, to restore the circulation
of the blood.
</p>

<p>
From Heriot's hands he received some warm
milk, mixed with brandy&mdash;milk from the stores of
soldered tin&mdash;and this luxury he swallowed with
ease; but yet seemed as one in a dream, and in
broken accents, he muttered of pain, and in a dreary
and bewildered way, of his "poor dear girls, whom
he should never see again."
</p>

<p>
Then he fell into a sound sleep, with Ethel's soft
white arm under his head, and she listened to his
heavy respirations, more with fear than any other
emotion, lest each long-drawn breath might prove
the last.
</p>

<p>
But Heriot, who patted her kindly and caressingly
on the head, sought to smile those fears away, by
telling her that "all danger was past now," and so
the second day of restoration gradually stole away.
</p>

<p>
Another night of complete repose "sent Mr. Basset
a long way on the voyage of recovery," as
Captain Phillips said, when peeping into the little
cabin, where the pale, affectionate, and unwearied
watcher, though her eyes were bloodshot, and had
dark rings under them, yet hung over her charge,
and now Rose came to take her place.
</p>

<p>
"How is dear papa this morning?" she asked,
anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"All well, Rose, darling, if the old boy will only
keep up his pluck," was the doctor's unpoetical
reply, as he slyly kissed the pretty inquirer, and
led away Ethel, who he insisted should take a
little repose, with the announcement that she "was
quite killing herself; and he would not stand it, as
he was accountable to the captain for the health of
all on board&mdash;and then Morley must not see how ill
she was looking."
</p>

<p>
As for poor Morley, she could see but little of
him just then, for he, with Bartelot, Morrison,
Gawthrop, and Foster, were never off the deck,
where by his skill and activity he won golden
opinions from the captain, whose anxieties (when
the distance he had yet to run, the size of his
crippled ship when compared with the slender crew,
the prospect of water running short, and having to
keep a look-out for those three proas, are all
considered) were certainly not small.
</p>

<p>
To Rose Basset, our medical friend Leslie Heriot,
a good, kind-hearted, sensible, and practical Scotsman,
had been at first but a source of lively little
flirtation and fun&mdash;a dangler, an admirer, and
nothing more.  At home she always had a dozen
such; it was Rose's habit and way; but now, as
his earnestness, and the troubles and dangers they
shared together, created a deeper emotion in her
breast, he gradually became the dream, the <i>beau-ideal</i>
of a warm-hearted young girl's passionate and
often senseless first love; and to the conclusion of
her portion of the voyage&mdash;when she, Ethel, and
papa would land at Port Louis, and when Leslie
must sail on to Singapore, a vast distance, of which
she had very little conception, save that it was
far, far away up the Indian seas&mdash;to that period,
we say, she looked forward with dismay and
alarm.
</p>

<p>
Long and perilous though the voyage had been,
it was not yet long enough for Rose, who was
desperately in love with the young Scotch doctor.
</p>

<p>
And now that Leslie, by his skill, care, and
tenderness, had saved her father from death, had
restored him to life and to his daughters, he became
an idol, whom she felt that she and Ethel should
worship with all their hearts; and Ethel's quiet,
earnest, and great gratitude to her sister's lover
was only equalled by the sincere regard and esteem
she had for him.
</p>

<p>
On the other hand, the filial love, the tender
solicitude, and unwearying attention of these two
girls to their suffering father charmed all, but none
more than old Captain Phillips, whose experience of
the sex was chiefly gained amid the hurly-burly of
seaports.
</p>

<p>
"Aha!" said he, slapping Morley on the back,
and winking knowingly to Heriot, "that is the sort
of thing I like to see; that is the kind of discipline
that prepares the daughter for the wife, and the
wife for being a mother.  God bless them all!" he
added, uncorking a square case-bottle, to pour forth
a libation in honour of his opinions.
</p>

<p>
"You are right, captain," said the doctor, who, in
his shirt-sleeves, was busy preparing breakfast, as
Noah came from the galley with a steaming kettle,
for they had now to do all things in turn.
</p>

<p>
"Better to share a crust in a wigwam with a dear
good girl like Miss Ethel Basset, than have an
heiress with only her dirty acres to recommend
her&mdash;your health, doctor&mdash;them's Jack Phillips's
sentiments."
</p>

<p>
Morley gave an unconscious sigh, for the poor
fellow felt bitterly that he had not even "the
crust" referred to by the captain.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Basset has the patience of a vestal in these
long and pious vigils of the night," said Heriot,
with enthusiasm.  "She and Rose have, indeed,
hearts formed for tenderness, and for doing all the
kind duties of life."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, doctor, very true; and I begin to think, if
I could change my bachelor ways a bit, and warp
close into the matrimonial haven, there is a plump
little widow at Gravesend that wouldn't mind
changing her name to Mrs. Jack Phillips."
</p>

<p>
As the captain said this, there was a gratified
twinkle in his merry blue eye, and quite a little
blush on his brown cheek; then he added, hastily:
</p>

<p>
"Now, doctor, that ham seems done to a turn.
Pour out the coffee, Ashton; I must be off on deck
for the breeze holds steady, and this is our last tack
south-west'ard towards the coast of Africa."
</p>

<p>
"Our last?" repeated Morley, mechanically.
</p>

<p>
"Positively for the last time, as the play-bills
have it, thank Heaven, and the wind it sends us."
</p>

<p>
"Thank Heaven, say I too.  I only wish, further,
that we were round Cape St. Mary."
</p>

<p>
"That will come too, all in good time, please God."
</p>

<p>
Some time elapsed before Mr. Basset knew
all he had undergone, and before he became fully
aware of the vast service rendered to him by
Dr. Heriot.  For a time the poor man was awed,
and humbled, and overwhelmed by all he had been
subjected to.
</p>

<p>
On the morning he heard all this for the first
time, Captain Phillips shook him by the hand, and
said, laughing:
</p>

<p>
"Bailie Nicol Jarvie says, 'My conscience, hang
a bailie!' but here we have actually had a judge
hanged at the yardarm, aboard this 'ere ship, and
yet never a hair the worse, thanks to Dr. Heriot
here."
</p>

<p>
"Please, captain, don't speak of it," whispered
Ethel.
</p>

<p>
"God bless you, my dear sir," said Mr. Basset,
grasping both Heriot's hands in his.  "He only can
reward you for your kindness and exercise of your
skill; but I am <i>the worse</i>, Captain Phillips, and
never again shall be half the man I was."
</p>

<p>
"Take courage, sir," said Morley; "we never
know what is before us."
</p>

<p>
"But I feel in every limb and fibre, Morley, that
I never shall fully recover the shock my nervous
system has sustained."
</p>

<p>
"You shall, sir&mdash;you shall in time," said Heriot.
"Only take courage, as Ashton says."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, how miraculous it seems," murmured the
poor gentleman, as his wasted hand played with the
rich brown tresses of Rose, who half knelt and half
reclined beside his bed, with her eyes beaming
smiles alternately on him and on her lover, Heriot;
"how miraculous, indeed.  Restored to life&mdash;restored
to life, and to my girls&mdash;restored, after
enduring, apparently, all the mental and bodily pangs
of a shocking and terrible death!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, dearest papa; it is, indeed, a debt of
gratitude we owe to Dr. Heriot," said Ethel.
</p>

<p>
"For Heaven's sake, Miss Basset, don't go on
this way," said Heriot.  "You make a poor fellow
quite ashamed of doing his mere duty."
</p>

<p>
"By what can I ever recompense you, Doctor
Heriot?" said Mr. Basset; "what reward can I
ever give you?"
</p>

<p>
"I think I know, sir," said the captain, winking
with great mystery; while Rose, who felt a scene
impending, grew pale, and trembled.
</p>

<p>
"You do?" asked Mr. Basset.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; and so does Miss Ethel&mdash;and so do we all."
</p>

<p>
"Look, papa&mdash;I think Dr. Heriot will consider
this the most valued fee you can give him," said
Ethel, as she playfully put Rose's right hand in that
of the doctor, who reddened to the roots of his
hair, and, for a brave and sensible fellow, really
looked very foolish.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Basset stared at them all round in perplexity;
then, as a sudden light seemed to break in
upon him, he smiled, and said:
</p>

<p>
"Is it so, Ethel?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, dear papa."
</p>

<p>
"And Rose, my little pet, what do you say?"
</p>

<p>
Rose smiled, and sobbed, and grew pale and red,
and wished herself on deck.
</p>

<p>
"So be it, then.  I can't part with her, Heriot;
but God bless you both, and keep you ever by me,"
said Mr. Basset, as he closed his eyes wearily, and
lay back to sleep.
</p>

<p>
Poor Heriot's happiness made him giddy, and he
grew as pale as if sentence of death had been
passed on him.  He could scarcely believe it all;
but he kissed Ethel, who had concocted this little
tableau; and Rose clasped the fat jolly captain
round his short neck, calling him her "dear old
thing."  He returned her embrace with extreme
cordiality, and no doubt wished he was as close to
the plump widow of Gravesend.
</p>

<p>
"How happy I am," said Ethel, blushing with
pleasure; "our troubles seem nearly over now."
</p>

<p>
"And I, too, am happy&mdash;oh, so happy!" said
Rose; "I would not exchange positions, Leslie, to
be Queen of England&mdash;or Scotland, if you like it
better, Heriot, dear."
</p>

<p>
"And never was M.D. of my old <i>Alma Mater</i>
rewarded by a fee so droll and handsome," said
Heriot, smiling fondly on the lively and laughing
girl, who clung to his arm as they went on deck
together.
</p>

<p>
Thus, as Mrs. Lirriper says, "All true life is gain,
and the sorrows that befall us are none other than
solemn massive foundation-stones, laid below the
unfathomable gloom, that a measureless content
may be built upon them."
</p>

<p>
But there were on board another pair of lovers in
whom we should be equally interested, and whose
prospects were not so bright, perhaps, for Heriot
had an income, however small, and plenty of
"expectations."
</p>

<p>
When the excitement, consequent to Mr. Basset's
illness, if we may term it so, and to Pedro's story,
death, and burial were all passed, Morley Ashton
and Ethel resumed their usual habit of thought;
and again in their communings they began to speculate
on their future, and to hope that, on reaching
the Isle of France, Mr. Basset, by his legal
influence, would be able to procure for him some
suitable employment, by means of which he could
make an adequate livelihood&mdash;the hope that dawned
of old at Laurel Lodge&mdash;and their engagement
might be fulfilled.
</p>

<p>
But Mr. Basset, to whom Morley had spoken of
these things, somewhat dashed their cherished
hopes, by frequently shaking his head, and declaring
that his health had suffered so much, that he felt
himself quite inadequate to assume his place on the
bench, and that hence all local and legal influence
would be gone.
</p>

<p>
There were times, too, when he became quite
gloomy, and feared, he said, that he "might only
land to die&mdash;land to be laid in a foreign soil, far
from that God's acre, where his dear wife lay
at Acton-Rennel; and then, what would become
of his poor girls without a protector in the
world?"
</p>

<p>
These gloomy forebodings filled Ethel with sickening
apprehension.  This was a probable catastrophe,
the anticipation of which also made Morley
miserable, and he begged Mr. Basset not to speak thus
before his eldest daughter; but he rather liked the
luxury of dilating on the chances of his own
demise.
</p>

<p>
However, they little knew what fate or fortune
had in store for them at the Isle of France, or
whether they should ever see that isle at all; and
despite his melancholy forebodings, which were
merely the result of his shaken nervous system,
Mr. Basset recovered rapidly, and on that day, when the
<i>Hermione</i> was near the close of her last long tack
towards the coast of Africa, he was conveyed on
deck, to have a look at Cape Corientes, which is the
most eastern portion of the land of Inhambane, and
is almost immediately under the Tropic of Capricorn.
</p>

<p>
Faint and blue the headland rose at the horizon,
from a golden-coloured sea, about thirty miles
distant, and, through a double-barrelled glass, its
outline could be clearly distinguished against the
rarefied sky beyond.
</p>

<p>
"And that is Africa!" said Ethel, regarding the
blue streak with her heart full of great thoughts,
and her dark eyes full of intelligence and interest as
she remembered all she had heard and read of Park
and Livingstone, Speke and Grant.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Miss Basset," said Morrison, "and a great
river, called the Inhambane, flows into the
Mozambique Channel but a few miles north of that
promontory."
</p>

<p>
"How I should like to land&mdash;to tread the soil
there, where it but for only a minute, Morley."
</p>

<p>
"Why so, Ethel?" asked Morley, smiling at her
enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know, but I should like to do so, and
yet I know not why."
</p>

<p>
"I think I could tell you, miss," said Morrison.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; that you might say with the Roman of
old, 'Ego in Africa,'" replied the Scotch mate,
glancing from Ethel to the doctor, who smiled at
his countryman's apt allusion.
</p>

<p>
"Is that your idea, Ethel?" asked Heriot.
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
But now there was a sudden bustle, when the
male inhabitants of this floating speck upon the sea
hastened to their various quarters, as she was to be
put about, on her last tack in the Mozambique&mdash;a
long run of many, many miles ere she would sight
the isle of Madagascar.
</p>

<p>
"Ready about, my friends!" cried the captain,
as he took his station on the weather side of the
quarter-deck; "helm's a lee&mdash;tacks and sheets&mdash;let
go and haul!" followed each other rapidly.
</p>

<p>
Noah had the wheel, and down went the helm at
a signal from Phillips, the fore tack and main sheet
were let go, round swung the yards in their iron
slings, aft came the main sheet, and then the spanker,
eased gradually off, fell away to leeward.
</p>

<p>
Round came the ship bravely, and with the monsoon
filling all her sails, she stood off in the opposite
direction to that she had hitherto been pursuing,
her starboard tacks on board, and lying almost at a
right angle from her long white frothy wake, which
could be distinctly traced in the pure green of the
sea, and soon after the faint blue outline of Cape
Corientes sank into the evening haze upon the lee
quarter.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
<br /><br />
RADAMA PUFFADDER.
</h3>

<p>
It was a pleasant sunny morning when Ethel was
roused by Morley tapping on her cabin-door, and
making the cheerful announcement that land was
in sight, almost ahead, so she and Rose made a
rapid toilette and joined him and the rest of their
friends on deck.
</p>

<p>
The south-west wind held steadily, and its breath
rippled all the morning sea in wavelets that seemed
tipped with gold.  The sunshine, bright and warm,
spread a yellow tint over all the western quarter of
the sky.  In dark outline, as if tinted with indigo,
about ten miles distant, rose a mountain, in the
form of a sugar-loaf, blending at its base with
lesser ones that were near to the sea.
</p>

<p>
"Madagascar, Ethel," said Morley, with a bright
smile, as he pointed to the coast.
</p>

<p>
"And yonder headland is Cape St. Mary," added
Dr. Heriot.  "I should know the place pretty well
by this time."
</p>

<p>
"Why, Leslie?" asked Rose.
</p>

<p>
"Because I see it now for the fourth time."
</p>

<p>
"Poor Leslie!" said Rose; "and you have gone
those long voyages so often, when I knew nothing
of them."
</p>

<p>
"Or&mdash;of me, Rose."
</p>

<p>
"That does seem so strange now!"
</p>

<p>
"However, Rose, I have no intention of voyaging
much more, 'for there's a good time coming,' as
the song says."
</p>

<p>
Morrison had the wheel, and the captain desired
him to "hug the land, and keep close in shore, as
he wanted to procure fresh water."
</p>

<p>
"I find that the needle varies at times in these
waters, sir," said Morrison.
</p>

<p>
"Aye&mdash;but our patent steering compass always
holds true."
</p>

<p>
Though the long and remarkable coast they were
approaching is flat and low near the shore, the sea
around it is without hidden danger in the form of
shoals, rocks, or reefs, and water fifty fathoms deep
can be found within four miles of it.
</p>

<p>
As the ship drew nearer, objects became more
distinct&mdash;strange trees, gigantic plants, and fantastic
wigwams, like bee-hives; and after breakfast, Ethel
and Rose, with their op era-glasses, could see these
features plainly, and particularly a headland, covered
with tufted palm-trees.
</p>

<p>
"And that is Cape St. Mary?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied Morley, who, to support her, had
one arm round Ethel and another round the mizzen-shrouds,
for the deck was slippery with the morning
dew and the spray that flew over it now and then,
for the ship careened well over beneath the breeze,
which was now almost abeam.
</p>

<p>
"Then we are out of the Mozambique Channel?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; or nearly so.  By noon we shall be quite
out of it."
</p>

<p>
"Thank Heaven!  I wish we were only a little
nearer Port Louis."
</p>

<p>
"We shall soon be so, Ethel, after leaving this
shore."
</p>

<p>
"Don't deem me foolish, dearest; but, after all
we have suffered, I always tremble when I think
of&mdash;of&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What, Ethel?
</p>

<p>
"Of those three piratical proas which the captain
speaks about.  I dreamt of them last night, and
saw them quite full of wild black fellows, with
spears, plumes, and war-paint&mdash;just like the pictures
we have seen of the savages who killed Captain
Cook."
</p>

<p>
"The coast hereabout looks wild and solitary
indeed."
</p>

<p>
"A few miles eastward lies Fort Dauphin," said
the doctor; "it was an old French settlement, but
was deserted and ruined long ago."
</p>

<p>
Anxious, we have said, to procure water, the
captain stood close in towards one of the little isles
that lie about the south-western extremity of
Madagascar; and now every man on board, except the
convalescent Mr. Basset, had to work hard in taking
in and stowing some of the fore-and-aft canvas,
getting the kedge anchors and warps ready, having
the boats clear, and the soundings had to be
attended to without intermission.
</p>

<p>
A curiously-built native boat was now seen
approaching swiftly from the shore, having suddenly
shot out of a creek.  It was very long, very low,
and was paddled by two men.
</p>

<p>
"Hollo, ladies!" cried Noah Gawthrop, who was
busy in the remaining quarter-boat, getting the
fall-tackles clear; "look at this swell coming along-side
in a cocked hat, like a wice-admiral o' the fleet!
But I beg parding, marm," he added, suddenly, as
Ethel adjusted the screw of her lorgnette, "you
mustn't look at him, for he ain't nothin' on but the
cocked hat and a necklace."
</p>

<p>
"Sheep 'hoy!" cried a shrill voice, as the boat
rose and fell on the waves.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want, darkey?" asked Noah.
</p>

<p>
"You savey me?" cried the Malay.
</p>

<p>
"No, I am blow'd if I do," was the surly reply.
</p>

<p>
"What for you no savey me?" remonstrated the
other; "yam, yam&mdash;sell, sell&mdash;nice, nice, nice."
</p>

<p>
Then he held up an inverted bottle, to show that
it was empty.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove! 'tis old Captain Puffadder!"
exclaimed Captain Phillips, as the native boat came
sheering alongside, and a white-headed Malay, who
literally had no other attire than a necklace of
crystal beads and an old battered naval cocked hat,
which some man-o'-war wag had given him,
relinquishing his carved teak-wood paddle, caught
with great dexterity a line which was cast to him,
and made it fast to a round knob at the prow of
his boat, which, as the line became taut, fell at
once into the ship's wake astern.
</p>

<p>
"It is old Radama Puffadder, whom we saw on
our two last voyages.  He sells vegetables and
fruit to any ship that comes close enough in shore,"
said Heriot, looking round for the young ladies;
but when the boat had come nearer, the utter want
of attire displayed by the two Malays had fairly
driven the Misses Basset and Nance Folgate down
the stair of the companion, where the merry but
half-stifled laugh of Rose could be heard from time
to time.
</p>

<p>
"A sly old file!" said Mr. Foster, looking over
the taffrail.
</p>

<p>
"How are you, Puff, my boy?" asked the doctor;
"what have you got for us?"
</p>

<p>
The old Malay, who was hideously ugly, and
whose bare, attenuated form was brown as old
mahogany, lifted his cocked hat, and replied in what
seemed an unintelligible torrent of consonants, and
then held up a turtle by one of its hind feet, after
which he grinned and yelled.
</p>

<p>
He and his companion next hauled in the tow-line,
hand over hand, till the boat was close to the
lee mizzen-chains&mdash;the chances of being swamped
seemed nothing to Captain Puffadder&mdash;and to
Morley, who stood on the channel-plate, he handed
on board whatever he had to offer, and in a short
time there was on deck a goodly pile of the
yellow-bellied gourds for boiling and eating, with butter
and milk; bananas, to roast like apples; peas,
beans, and water-melons; brown-skinned onions,
and golden-coloured oranges and lemons; together
with a great sprawling turtle, the sight of which
would have made an alderman's eyes twinkle; and
there, too, were six brace of wood-pigeons.
</p>

<p>
For all this seasonable stock, the captain paid
him by six bottles of strong alcohol, three boxes of
lucifer-matches, and a dollar or two, and these coins,
when cut into four, form the circulating medium in
the "Great Britain of Africa."
</p>

<p>
The captain and the doctor, who seemed to
understand and amuse themselves with the jargon
of "Captain" Puffadder, inquired where fresh
water was to be had, and he led them to understand
that, under the brow of the cliff to which he
pointed, there was a creek in one of the islets; that
there several springs flowed, and safe anchorage
would be found.
</p>

<p>
"This will suit admirably," said Phillips, to
Bartelot.  "We shall lie there a couple of days,
for some of our rigging requires overhauling
sorely."
</p>

<p>
"Won't you come on board, Puff, and pilot us,
while we run in?" asked Mr. Foster.
</p>

<p>
"I no savey <i>that</i>&mdash;no can do," replied the Malay,
as he let his boat drop astern, and, taking a long
pull at one of the rum-bottles, he grinned with
satisfaction and handed it to his longing companion.
</p>

<p>
"Won't you remain with us till we have filled
our water-tank?" cried the captain over the
taffrail.
</p>

<p>
Again the dingy Malay grinned and shook his
white head, which looked as if it had been snowed
over, and, pointing shoreward, to indicate that he
must return, cast off the tow-line, after which his
boat, that bobbed up and down like a cork, was
rapidly dropped astern.
</p>

<p>
The wind was now becoming light, and, with
Morley and Heriot stripped to their shirt-sleeves,
pulling ahead in the quarter-boat, and Mr. Foster
in her bow, sounding carefully every minute with
hand-lead, the ship was steered by the captain in
person towards the creek, the entrance of which
was seen to open plainly enough under the brow of
the cliff, at the base of which some breakers were
boiling white upon a ridge of rock, "like the devil's
own milk," as Noah said, adding:
</p>

<p>
"I wonder why the deuce that old fellow
wouldn't come aboard?  I hope it isn't a snare,
this kind inwitation to anchor in a creek."
</p>

<p>
"A snare, Noah?" repeated Bartelot.
</p>

<p>
"'Cause, sir, he has the look of an old wrecker,
to my mind."
</p>

<p>
A dead calm soon fell upon the land and sea, and
from the square yards of the <i>Hermione</i>, her fore and
maincourse, and a jury main-topsail, hung down
straight and motionless, till they were hauled up
prior to furling, as she glided slowly, and with
almost imperceptible motion, through the narrow
gut of the creek.
</p>

<p>
"Leather strip&mdash;ten fathoms; red rag&mdash;seven
fathoms; seven again; white rag&mdash;five fathoms,"
Foster kept repeating from time to time, as he hove
the hand-line from the bow of the leading boat.
Bartelot and Morrison were also in it, and pulling
with all their strength, for they had the kedge
anchors and a couple of strong Manilla warps with
them.
</p>

<p>
Beyond its narrow entrance, which was almost
shrouded in mangroves, that brushed the ship's
channels, the creek opened out into a tiny bay, or
oval-shaped basin, and there, before sunset had
beamed its red farewell upon the summit of the
rocks, the <i>Hermione</i>, with her courses hauled, her
jury topsail-yards lowered upon the cap, her spanker
brailed up, and her jib and stay-sails stowed away,
was moored quietly, as if in the middle of a dock,
by two warps, one at the stem and the other at
the stern, both being carried ashore to her kedge
anchors, which were embedded in the banks, among
the mangroves and other luxuriant vegetation that
grew down to the water's edge.
</p>

<p>
"From here to Port Louis we have a run of
about seven hundred odd miles," said Captain
Phillips; "the season is fine; but we shall fall to
our work by daybreak to-morrow&mdash;fill the tank&mdash;overhaul
the fore rigging, have it tarred down and
rattled anew in some parts, and then be off with the
first breeze of wind, as I don't fancy the Madagascar
fever."
</p>

<p>
"And this creek, with its mangroves dipping in
the slimy ooze, seems just the place to catch it,"
said Tom Bartelot.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose it was in some such cliff as that,
Ethel," said Morley, looking up at the tall rocky
brow which overhung the creek, "that old Marco
Polo, who, it seems, wrote about Madagascar in the
thirteenth century, says the birds called the roc
built their nests."
</p>

<p>
"Were they like Sindbad's roc?" asked Rose.
</p>

<p>
"Larger, says old Marco, in form resembling an
eagle, and so huge that they would soar into the air
with the largest elephant in their talons, and let it
fall dead on the earth prior to devouring it; and
that their wings, which, when outspread, obscured
the sunshine like a flying cloud, measured forty-eight
feet apart, each pen-feather being twenty-four
feet in length."
</p>

<p>
"There is nothing like telling a good story when
one is about it; but I hope the breed is extinct,"
said Rose.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; like the giant wader of Australia, if it
ever existed at all."
</p>

<p>
As the evening closed in, with no thought of
local danger or treachery, but enjoying the brief
cessation from the constant toil to which they were
subjected by the smallness of their number, and
thinking only of the termination of their voyage
and a happy future, our friends were all grouped
under the quarter-deck awning, and Noah was
enjoying a quiet pipe at the windlass-bitt, with a can
of grog beside him.
</p>

<p>
Aft, the top of the cabin skylight had been
covered with a white cloth and improvised as a
table, on which were spread some of the luscious
fruits and sliced water-melon bought from the
Malay, Puffadder, and a bottle or two of the
captain's best wine.
</p>

<p>
Then, that music might not be wanting, Ethel
and Rose, uniting their clear, sweet, happy voices,
while Heriot accompanied them on his flute, which
he played to perfection, sang one of their favourite
duets, waking the echoes of the rocks, and rousing
out of the mangroves the stork, the pelican, and the
samba, with its plumage red as fire: while the red
sunlight died away, and the tropical constellations
came out, and while the solemn shadows deepened
in that lonely creek, the soft English voices of the
two sisters so well attuned together, filled Noah's
stern eyes with moisture, and his rough old head
with sweet, sad holy thoughts of other times, as he
listened, and sat alone, the last occupant of the once
crowded and noisy forecastle-bunks.
</p>

<p>
That lonely creek was fated to present a very
different scene about the same hour on the morrow!

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><br />
THE MANGROVE CREEK.
</h3>

<p>
The secluded creek in which the ship lay moored
had a little history of its own, that was better than
the misty recollections of old Marco Polo, who,
by-the-way, never visited Madagascar at all.  It was
in this solitary little basin, or natural dock, that the
high-pooped and low-waisted caravella of the first
discoverer of Madagascar, Lorenzo Almieda (son of
Don Francisco Almieda, viceroy of India for Don
Emmanuel of Portugal, in 1506), came to anchor,
after a voyage that was long and perilous; and now,
as our friends Morley and Heriot gazed on its
strange and fantastic cliffs, the former thought of
the Serendib of the "Arabian Nights," and the
latter, who was better read, recalled the Island of
the Moon, and the Cerne of Pliny, with the works
of other writers, who averred that Madagascar was
an isle divided between two races&mdash;one of giants,
and another of dwarfs&mdash;the Kimos&mdash;about three
feet high.  These were always at war, until the
former were victorious, at a place called Itapere,
two leagues south-west of Fort Dauphin, where a
pyramid of stones attests the alleged slaughter and
destruction of the poor dwarfs.
</p>

<p>
The creek was also known to be the haunt of the
famous freebooter, Captain Avery, an Englishman
who gained vast plunder by his piracies against
the emperors of Mogul and China, and who, about
the latter year of Queen Anne's reign, lived in and
about Madagascar, with the strange title of King of
the Seas.
</p>

<p>
Not the least remarkable features of this creek
were its enormous blocks of rock crystal, that
sparkled in the sunshine with a thousand prisms of
wonderful light and beauty.  Trees surrounded it;
the tall and straight voua-azigne; the bushy fouraka,
distilling its green-coloured balsam; the wild fig,
whose fruit yields a milky juice; the palm-tree,
whose leaves are like feathers, and form roofing for
wigwams; the ancient papyrus, the cotton and the
nutmeg trees, all grew on the rocks; while betel,
pepper, and tobacco were the weeds that grew
among the jungle, where the puff adder&mdash;a
reptile about a yard long&mdash;and other serpents
lurked.
</p>

<p>
Just as the sun was rising in his tropical splendour
from the sea, and through the opening to the
eastward sent a glorious flush of light into the leafy
recesses of the creek, Noah caught a couple of
gallant turtles, each weighing nearly three hundred
pounds.
</p>

<p>
After bringing them on board, he lowered them
into the water by a line, tied, as sailors alone can
tie, round them, and left them to paddle about, to
swim, duck, or dive as they pleased, till required for
the larder.
</p>

<p>
As for the one brought by Captain Puffadder, he
flatly refused to kill it till sunset, on the plea that "a
turtle never dies till the sun goes down, that he
warn't goin' to be so jolly cruel as to leave it a nole
day in a nagony."
</p>

<p>
From the deck Ethel and Rose, with their opera-glasses,
were never weary of watching all the strange
trees, plants, birds, and insects that surrounded
them; everything seemed novel, save the turtles,
which, of course, were like those they had seen
squattering in fish-tubs at home.
</p>

<p>
Prior to their appearance on deck, with the first
peep of dawn, a long hose, water-casks, and so
forth, had been put in operation, and thus, before
noon, a sufficient supply of pure water had been
pumped into the tank from a spring which flowed
over a mass of crystal rock, and through the decayed
trunk of a fallen tree, which formed a species of
natural duct.
</p>

<p>
Morrison, Foster, and Noah Gawthrop then fell to
work upon the starboard side of the fore-rigging;
Phillips and Tom Bartelot on the other, and all
proceeded to tar down, and in many places to rattle
anew the shrouds, and various other repairs went on
with rapidity; while the doctor and Morley, with a
gun, went ashore, and ascended the rocks towards
the summit of the cliff, which overhangs the entrance
of the creek.
</p>

<p>
The ascent proved long and toilsome, for
everywhere the matted jungle grew thick; the weedy
luxuriance there is wonderful, and so woven that it
seems the result, not of a season's rank vegetation,
but of ages; and as many little reptiles are always
lurking amid it, no small care is requisite for
avoiding them.
</p>

<p>
At last the two explorers reached the plateau, or
summit of the cliff, and merrily gave a united shout,
which made their friends at work on the fore-rigging
pause and look up, and Ethel and Rose, who
were seated on the quarter-deck, wave their
handkerchiefs in response.
</p>

<p>
From the elevation of more than 300 feet, the
creek, when viewed, seemed like a pool, the ship a
toy.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the islet Morley and Heriot saw the
whole sweep of the southern end of the great island
of Madagascar, from Cape St. Mary towards Ainse
des Galiona, with the pale blue and distant summit
of Botistmeni, the highest mountain to the
southward of that lofty chain which divides the island
into two parts.
</p>

<p>
In many places the coast was flat and low, and by
their glasses they could see that the shore looked
green and slimy, and here and there were dome-shaped
huts of mud and palm-leaves, sheltered by
clumps of ebony and raven trees.
</p>

<p>
North-westward, the ocean they hoped to traverse
on the morrow was flashing in its noonday brilliance;
but it seemed lonely and void; not a sail was visible
on all its vast expanse.  Towards the south-west
the higher portions of the islet hid the watery path
they had pursued from the great channel of the
Mozambique.
</p>

<p>
"We may ascend higher in <i>that</i> direction," said
Morley, pointing, "and see if a sail is in sight
there."
</p>

<p>
"Stop!" exclaimed Heriot, in an excited tone, as
he applied to his eyes his powerful double-barrelled
ship-glass, and gazed intently towards the mainland.
</p>

<p>
"What do you see that interests you?"
</p>

<p>
"Look, Ashton, look!  What is that creeping out
from behind that wooded headland?"
</p>

<p>
"Where?"
</p>

<p>
"There&mdash;about five miles off."
</p>

<p>
"A boat&mdash;a long craft of some kind, without
masts."
</p>

<p>
"Another follows now."
</p>

<p>
"And another&mdash;all painted red!"
</p>

<p>
"Three!" said Heriot, in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
"The proas&mdash;the three red proas!"
</p>

<p>
"Down, Ashton, stoop down, lest they see our
figures at this distance against the clear sky!"
exclaimed the doctor, suiting the action to the word.
</p>

<p>
Lying at full length among the thick grass that
covered all the summit of the cliff, the two friends,
resting on their elbows, took a long sight of the
strange boats.
</p>

<p>
"Each is full of men.  I could count their heads."
</p>

<p>
"They are pulling fast, and steering direct for
this island!" exclaimed Heriot.
</p>

<p>
"We have been lured in here and deceived, I
doubt not, by that old Malay villain, Puffadder.
Old sailors have strange instincts at times, and
Noah seemed to suspect as much."
</p>

<p>
"This is why he would neither come on board nor
pilot us into the creek.  But we may do him an
injustice; he may not be in league with these
pirates at all."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Ethel!" exclaimed Morley, speaking as
if to himself, "your forebodings, your dreams are
perhaps about to be terribly realised."
</p>

<p>
"Let us away to the ship, we have not a moment
to lose!  See how the paddles flash in the sunshine.
They are all pulling as if the devil was after them!"
</p>

<p>
Their mode of rowing was peculiar, for the
paddlers all faced the bow of each proa, and scooped
the water astern.
</p>

<p>
Breathless with excitement, heat, and alarm,
and with their imaginations picturing visions of
cruelty and slaughter, Ashton and Heriot came
plunging down the jungle-covered steep with
such speed and impetuosity, that their friends in
the ship paused again and again to observe them
in wonder, though believing that they had some
very unusual reason for this sudden display of
activity.
</p>

<p>
Both were young, light, and active; thus, in less
than a quarter of an hour, they had reached the ship
by means of the gig, which they had left moored
among the mangroves, sprang on deck, and
reported what they had observed towards the
mainland of Madagascar.
</p>

<p>
Could they have seen a little way to the
south-west they might have observed something more;
but the sight of the three proas proved quite enough
for them.
</p>

<p>
Their tidings produced instant consternation.
</p>

<p>
"That wily old villain, Puffadder, has recommended
us to warp in here, and then betrayed our
whereabouts.  By Heavens&mdash;we are in a precious
mess!" exclaimed the captain.
</p>

<p>
"And Ethel and Rose," said Morley, turning to
Heriot, with a voice and face expressive of grief
and terror; "what is to be done now?"
</p>

<p>
"Done!  Why, sir, we must make the best of it,"
said Noah, energetically, as his old man-o'-war
instincts came upon him, and he began to strip to
his waist; "if these etarnal warmints get hold o' the
ship, they'll pick every copper nail out of her!"
</p>

<p>
"Captain Phillips," said Morrison, a sharp-witted
and resolute Scotchman, and who spoke with more
rapidity than his countrymen usually do; "the ship
is moored athwart the creek, with her port side to
the mouth of it.  Bring over her two starboard
carronades, and work the four in battery together.
Thus we may knock these proas all to pieces by
round shot as they head for the creek in succession."
</p>

<p>
"You speak like a nangel or a nadmiral,
Mr. Morrison!" said Noah.
</p>

<p>
"Excellent!" cried Phillips; "to work and with
a will, my friends."  He threw aside his coat, and
bouncing about with an agility remarkable for one
of his years and fat little figure, added, "Bring on
deck all the arms and ammunition we have, doctor;
get the powder out of the magazine aft, Mr. Ashton;
and take your daughters below, Mr. Basset, please,
for the sight of their pale and woe-begone faces
flurries me.  Look alive, my hearties.  Captain
Bartelot and Mr. Morrison help me here; bear a
hand to cast loose these two starboard guns."
</p>

<p>
The two carronades were soon clear, their tompions
taken out, their touch-holes cleaned, and they
were run over to the port or larboard side.  Originally
the <i>Hermione</i> had been pierced for twelve guns,
but, as we have stated, she had only four six-pound
carronades, and only four shot remaining for each.
They were loaded, shotted, and primed with great
rapidity by Noah, who used a capstan-bar as a
rammer.  Then, diving below, he suddenly
reappeared from the steerage with a hamper full of
empty bottles.
</p>

<p>
"What are these for?" asked Captain
Phillips.
</p>

<p>
"Grape and canister, sir," replied old Noah, as
he proceeded to smash the bottles and fill the
carronades with the fragments even to their very
muzzles.
</p>

<p>
Morley was too busy distributing powder, even
to speak one farewell word to Ethel, as she was
taken below by Heriot, who soon after reappeared
with all the arms they had on board: to wit&mdash;his
own pair of excellent pistols, the captain's two
six-barrel revolvers, six old brass-barrelled pistols taken
from the mutineers, their sheath-knives, the
double-barrelled fowling-piece, a sharp hatchet, and a
harpoon.
</p>

<p>
Thus they had nearly a brace of pistols each, and,
fortunately, plenty of ball ammunition made up into
cartridge form for the contingencies of the
Madagascar coast.
</p>

<p>
In less than ten minutes all was in readiness; all
were certainly silent, pale, and desperate, for all felt
that death and utter destruction were awfully close
at hand.
</p>

<p>
The misery of the Bassets and the two lovers was
more poignant than any emotion felt by their
companions, who were chiefly inspired by the natural
impulse of self-preservation, without the paralysing
horror that on their lives depended the lives of
others who were most dear to them; but the whole
affair had come upon them with the suddenness of a
thunderclap, and as yet, perhaps, they could scarcely
understand the terrors of their situation.
</p>

<p>
"These cursed proas were about five miles off,
you say, doctor?" said the captain, in a low voice,
as he looked at his watch.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir; five to leeward of the island."
</p>

<p>
"The wind is light, though increasing."
</p>

<p>
"They had neither spars nor sails up, sir, and so
may not be here for more than an hour yet, though
swiftly paddled."
</p>

<p>
"They may not come here at all," said Bartelot;
"for perhaps they may be quite ignorant that we
are lying in the creek."
</p>

<p>
"If not aware now they will soon be," said
Morley; "they were steering directly for the creek,
and I don't think these mangroves will hide the
ship's spars."
</p>

<p>
"Still they may pass it," said Tom, hopefully, as
he carefully capped his revolver, and slung it by his
side.
</p>

<p>
The others shook their heads despondingly, and
Noah put a quid into his cheek, with the nowise
cheering reflection that it was "mayhap the last"
he would ever put there.
</p>

<p>
"It was a fortunate proposal of yours to climb
the cliff, doctor," said Morley.
</p>

<p>
"I thank Heaven for the thought," replied Heriot,
emphatically; "for had those Malay devils found us
unprepared&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"My blood runs cold at the idea."
</p>

<p>
"How quietly they might have come upon us in
the night," suggested Morrison.
</p>

<p>
"They are perhaps strong enough to despise
stratagem," said Captain Phillips.
</p>

<p>
"More likely, sir, that old bumboatman, Puff,
hadn't time to blow the gaff on us, or we might all
have been with Davy Jones last night," said
Noah.
</p>

<p>
All spoke in a species of whisper, and all looked
at their watches from time to time, and listened so
intently, that an uninformed spectator might have
thought they were waiting with impatience, but
they heard no sound, save the buzz of insect life in
the mangroves and dense jungle, around that slimy
creek.
</p>

<p>
All was equally still below.  Secured in the cabin,
Ethel and Rose were on their knees, with their old
nurse, in an agony of terror, amid which they strove
in vain to pray.  Mr. Basset, too frail to work at the
guns, or be active in the defence of the deck, sat in
the companion-way, ready to reload the fire-arms
when they were discharged, and now Noah got the
matches ready.
</p>

<p>
How the old fellow's eyes lit up!  A brightness
spread over his storm-beaten and sorely-wrinkled
visage, making him seem almost young again, for
he felt that it was to him&mdash;the old man-o'-war's-man&mdash;he
who had heard the thunder of Sebastopol, and
seen the Russian bombs strewing all the Valley of
Death; he who had gone with Peel's Brigade and
Havelock's Highlanders to Lucknow and to Delhi&mdash;his
superiors and shipmates were now looking chiefly
for direction and advice.
</p>

<p>
They all knew well enough how to load and fire,
or ram home the charge with a capstan-bar; but
skill in adjusting the sight and the quoin under the
breech became a different affair.
</p>

<p>
"Now, gen'lemen shipmates by your leave," said
he, "we must fire and reload each gun as fast as
possible; but it will be safer if number four don't
fire till number <i>vun</i> is reloaded."
</p>

<p>
Almost despairing alike of a successful defence, or
an ultimate victory, Captain Phillips suggested the
idea of putting Mr. Basset and his two daughters
into the gig, and sculling her to a secluded place
among the mangroves.
</p>

<p>
"But, if the ship is taken, and we are all
destroyed," said Morley, "oh, what in Heaven's name
would become of them then?  They would die of
terror, exposure, and starvation."
</p>

<p>
"The creek is full of alligators, too!" added
Heriot.
</p>

<p>
"But what may happen to them on board if we
are all killed?" asked Captain Phillips.
</p>

<p>
The contemplation of that result nearly drove
Morley and Heriot mad, and they knew not what
to reply.
</p>

<p>
"It might give the poor ladies, at least, one other
chance for life if we hid them in the maintop, for
we may have to take to the rigging yet, if these
warmint capture the deck by boarding, and up there
we may have to fight to the last with knives or
pistols, or whatever we have."
</p>

<p>
"And how, Noah, if the Malays cut the mast away?"
</p>

<p>
"Or fire the ship?"
</p>

<p>
"No chance of escape, and none of rescue!"
groaned Captain Phillips; "there is a fine breeze in
the offing, as I can see by the whitening waves; but
here, with not hands enough to tow her out, the
crippled <i>Hermione</i> might as well be on the top of a
mountain."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, if I had that artful savage with the cocked
hat within range of this!" said Morley, through
his clenched teeth, as he slapped the butt of his
gun.
</p>

<p>
"Run up the ensign, Noah; let them look at
that, whoever they are.  We'll die game under it,
anyhow," said Phillips, as something of a British
sailor's pride and defiant spirit filled his heart.
</p>

<p>
"Aye," responded Noah, as he ran the scarlet
ensign up to the gaff-peak, where it floated languidly
at first on the still air of the sheltered creek,
but anon the coming breeze made it stream out
boldly; "many a round shot and Whistling-Dick
I've seen a bowlin' under you," added Noah, as he
made fast the halyards, looked up at the colour, and
nodded to it as to an old friend.
</p>

<p>
Anxiously the eyes of the "few but undismayed"&mdash;for
their courage certainly rose with the
desperation of the emergency&mdash;were turned to the
mouth of the creek, where, between the rocks and
mangroves, the deep blue Indian sea, now flecked
with white by the breath of a fine steady breeze,
was seen stretching in the distance far, far away,
until it blended with the sky.
</p>

<p>
Still nothing was seen and nothing heard!
</p>

<p>
But ere long, each of the eight men on the deck
of the <i>Hermione</i> set his teeth, breathed hard, and
turned to his companions, eye seeking eye, while
all their hearts beat quicker.
</p>

<p>
For suddenly there was an unmistakable sound of
paddling in the air, and then a shrill yell went up
to heaven, as the sharp red prow of a proa, full of
dark and active figures, shot round the entrance of
the creek, and a row of rapidly-worked round
paddles, shaped like huge battledores, furrowed up
all the slimy water into foam, as they headed her
straight for the ship.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><br />
EIGHT AGAINST EIGHTY.
</h3>

<p>
Noah had the first carronade on the right&mdash;that is,
abreast of the mainmast.  Stooping down, he
trained it carefully, elevating and then slightly
depressing the muzzle till he covered the object.
He then smartly withdrew, lowered the match, and
the recoil and report of the gun was followed by a
yell from the Malays, whose rowers were seen
tumbling from side to side, as if making summersets;
for the shot, with its scattering accompaniment
of broken bottles, made a complete lane from
stem to stern, through the dingy occupants of the
proa.
</p>

<p>
The echoes of the gun, with the cries of the
Malays, rung with a thousand reverberations amid
the rocks of the creek, startling clouds of wild birds
from the mangroves and cane-brake beyond them.
</p>

<p>
"Fire number two&mdash;steady, Captain Phillips,
please; here comes the next proa.  Blaze away at
the blasted warmint!  Rake her fore and aft before
she forges ahead!"
</p>

<p>
So shouted old Noah, while adroitly he assisted
the recoil of his carronade, ran it back with the
aid of Morley, and proceeded to reload and ram
home.  Captain Phillips, less used to this kind of work
than he, levelled his carronade and fired; but he had
not trained it properly, for, although the additional
charge of broken bottles did some execution among
the thick skulls of the Malays, the round shot
whistled harmlessly over them all, and was seen
ricochetting over the waves, till it made a white
water-spout in the offing, far beyond the mouth of
the creek.
</p>

<p>
Noah danced with disappointment and chagrin.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Mr. Morrison," he cried; "number three&mdash;level
low&mdash;quick! here comes the next lot, a
paddling like so many devils.  Sweep the scum into
eternity."
</p>

<p>
Morrison fired, and carried away the whole line of
starboard paddles, and with them, perhaps, the
rower's arms.  Then, veering round, she thus fell
foul of the first proa, just as the third came
sweeping round, and headed towards the creek.
</p>

<p>
The scene was now terrible; there were some
seventy or eighty Malays, many streaming with
blood, all waving their paddles and weapons, and
uttering such yells as one might imagine to rise
from the infernal regions&mdash;yells inspired alike by
the hope of plunder and of vengeance.
</p>

<p>
Then the contents of the third carronade, trained
by Heriot and Foster, sped on the errand of death,
right through them all, just as the leading proa got
clear.  Half its starboard side was torn away, and
thus all its occupants were left to swim or flounder;
the dead to sink and the wounded to drown, amid
the slimy ooze of the creek.
</p>

<p>
While more than twenty were swimming, splashing,
and scrambling ashore on each side, the
paddlers in the other proas resumed their work,
scooping the water astern with preternatural vigour,
but to avoid a raking shot, presented more of their
broadside to the ship, and hence retarded their own
progress; so Noah fired his carronade right through
one, just abaft the centre thwart, by this oblique
shot killing or disabling three or four.
</p>

<p>
The yells were now appalling, the scene terrible,
and yet withal most picturesque and striking.
</p>

<p>
The savage rabble in these proas were the
woolly-headed Madecasses, who are partly of African
descent; but all their leaders&mdash;and several
appeared in each proa&mdash;were olive-skinned men,
Hovahs, who are supposed to be of purer blood, and
are viewed by the people of Madagascar somewhat
as the Normans were by the Anglo-Saxons.
</p>

<p>
These men wore tunics of scarlet silk, like those
of the Chinese, girt by sashes or belts; but their
negro followers were naked, a few only having
clothes about their middle, or wearing the ordinary
garment of the Madecasses, which is made of bark,
boiled and beaten, and shaped like a flour-sack,
with a hole for the head, and four others for the
legs and arms.
</p>

<p>
All wore chains, ear-rings, and bracelets of crystal
cornelian, and even gold, and many were armed
with assegais, headed like spears, with long, sharp,
iron points; many had bucklers of hard wood,
covered with hides.  Some had ten or twelve javelins
each; a few had clumsy old muskets, fortunately
much addicted to hanging fire; and all had the
native creese&mdash;a long, wavy, double-edged dagger.
When we add to this equipment their black, ferocious
faces, their shrill yells and diabolical activity,
their white, glistening teeth, their glaring eyeballs,
and whole <i>tout ensemble</i>, the reader may imagine
the scene presented at this crisis in the mangrove
creek.
</p>

<p>
The explosion of the first carronade had drawn a
simultaneous shriek and shudder from the two
girls, and their old nurse, in the cabin, and a
cheer from their eight devoted friends on deck,
while with it, and with every future discharge, the
pintados, the black paroquets, the spoonbills, and
the turtle-doves flew in screaming coveys out of the
jungle.
</p>

<p>
"Depress your muzzles!" cried Noah, who had,
by tacit consent apparently, constituted himself
master-gunner; "they're nearing us, mates."
</p>

<p>
"Another dose of broken bottles; they make
first-rate grape and canister," added Morrison.
</p>

<p>
"Crouch down&mdash;crouch down&mdash;here's a volley of
something coming!" shouted Captain Phillips, from
his gun, as four or five musket-bullets crashed
through the bulwarks, and a number of arrows or
javelins and assegais, whistled harmlessly over their
heads, and fell pattering on the starboard side of
the deck, as fast as the survivors of the shattered
proas scrambled ashore, and began to use their
weapons.
</p>

<p>
"The warp&mdash;the starn warp!" shouted Noah, as
with muzzle depressed, he fired his carronade again;
"pick off some o' those d&mdash;&mdash;d heathen niggers
afore they cuts it, some one."
</p>

<p>
Two savages had already reached the warp, which
was carried through the taffrail to the kedge,
and were proceeding to slash through the strands
of the strong Manilla, hewing with their creeses,
and, had they done so, the ship must have swerved
round, and gone ashore, broadside on.
</p>

<p>
Morley snatched up the double-barrelled gun
which Mr. Basset had just reloaded.  Kneeling
down, he levelled it steadily through the taffrail,
and shot both down in quick succession&mdash;a strange
and wild emotion coming over him as he saw them
fall, and beat the earth with their hands and feet.
This cooled the ardour of five or six others, who
followed, for he saw them plunge down among the
mangroves, where they lay flat in concealment.
</p>

<p>
At that moment, a Hovah, in a crimson shirt,
who had clambered, all wet and dripping, up the
mizzen chains, launched an assegai at Morley, which
skinned his right ear, and stuck quivering in the
deck, near the coaming of the main-hatch.  He
then proceeded to scramble on board, with his
sharp creese in his teeth, and a savage glitter in his
eye, when Morley clubbed the double-barrelled gun.
and swinging it aloft at the full stretch of his arms,
dealt the Hovah a blow on his hard caput, which
tumbled him prone into the water; but the gun
was destroyed, as it snapped in two at the small
part of the butt.
</p>

<p>
Morley rushed back to rejoin his friends at the
carronades; but found poor Noah grappling with a
gigantic Malay, who had dropped over the bulwark
near the starboard quarter, where they were rolling
over each other, Noah swearing, and the Malay
biting and howling, till the former, grasping the
long, tawny ears of the latter, rings and all, dashed
his head thrice on the deck, when he stunned, and
then flung him overboard.
</p>

<p>
At that moment an arrow, which all feared might
be poisoned&mdash;whistled through Noah's cheeks,
knocking out a couple of his few remaining teeth;
but with a pistol he shot dead the archer, who was
nestling among the mangroves.
</p>

<p>
So far as the eight unfortunates on the deck of
the <i>Hermione</i> could judge, they had been attacked
by not less than eighty men!
</p>

<p>
Now the two proas were close alongside; another
moment would have seen the savage Malays swarming
in scores up the bulwarks and over the decks;
but just as a groan of dismay simultaneously burst
from the few devoted defenders of the <i>Hermione</i>,
her head warp was slashed through by creeses, and
she suddenly fell away round before the south-west
breeze, with her bow towards the sea, thus increasing
the distance between her assailants and herself by
the whole length of her stern warp, at a moment
when, all the Malays were in the act of standing up
to leap on board, and as she so swerved away, she
went right ashore, broadside on, amongst the
mangroves, with all her four carronades pointed to the
land, leaving her starboard side unprotected against
the yelling occupants of the two remaining proas.
</p>

<p>
"God help us!" cried poor Captain Phillips, in
despair; "all is over now!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><br />
"WE'LL GO TO SEA NO MORE!"
</h3>

<p>
The despairing exclamation of the worthy captain
had a very singular sequel, for scarcely had it left
his lips, and just when the paddlers were again
scooping away, as, with yells of exulting fury, the
Malays proceeded after the <i>Hermione</i>; just when
those who were ashore were forcing a passage to
her through the jungle, and when the full term
of another minute would have closed the whole
catastrophe&mdash;lo! with all the suddenness of a
spectral illusion, or of the Flying Dutchman's
famous craft, a noble-looking ship, all a cloud of
canvas, white as snow, swept round the verge of the
cliff, and lay to, right off the mouth off the creek.
</p>

<p>
Bending gracefully over beneath the south-west
breeze, she had her royals and topsails set, and the
scarlet British ensign streamed from her gaff-peak.
</p>

<p>
Like the work of magic, her lighter sails were
taken in, and her head-sails clewed up; then, as
she rounded to, under her mizzen-topsail, with her
broadside fairly opposed to the creek, a plunge was
heard as the great working anchor was let go.
</p>

<p>
At the same moment, fire and smoke burst from
her quarter, and ran like a flashing garland along
her whole side, as, with two twelve-pounders, and
about twenty short Enfield rifles, her crew opened
a destructive discharge on the Malays.
</p>

<p>
As the well-directed shot plunged through them,
the two remaining proas were dashed to pieces, and,
amid the fragments of wood, floating assegais, and
gouts of blood, their crews were seen making for
the mangroves, right and left, scrambling ashore,
and taking to flight in every direction.
</p>

<p>
The great ship had no occasion to discharge her
guns again; but the short Enfields of her crew
knocked over a number of the Malays, as they
became visible at times, while prosecuting their
flight inland.
</p>

<p>
The moment the firing ceased, and before the
white smoke had curled away, the yards were
manned, and the three topsails disappeared into
their bunt at once.  From the foretopgallant-yard
down to the stay, came the men, sliding like
lightning, to furl and stow the jib in its netting.
</p>

<p>
The great white courses were furled with equal
rapidity, and with a neatness that drew exclamations
of admiration, mingled with those of surprise and
joy, from those on the deck of the rescued <i>Hermione</i>.
Then down came the royal yards from aloft, and,
ere long, the great ship was bared of all, save
her bright scarlet ensign, which floated out
astern.
</p>

<p>
She was a splendid ship, full-rigged and full-manned,
with a clean, white paint-stroke, and gaily-gilded
quarter-galleries; she was remarkably
straight in the bends, like a Spaniard or a Yankee,
with all her rigging and spars in the finest order.
Thus she presented a noble appearance, as she rode
at her anchor under the brow of the lofty cliff.  Then,
with the same man-o'-war-like order and rapidity
which characterised all her other manoeuvres, a
boat was hoisted out, lowered away, and its crew
carried an anchor astern, to moor her more
securely.
</p>

<p>
From the stern davits, the captain's gig, light
and smart as a London wherry, was lowered with a
splash into the water.  He was seen to descend
the rope-ladder rapidly, to seat himself in the
stern and to grasp the yoke-lines, while a crew of
smart lads, chiefly ship-apprentices, pulled straight
through the bloody <i>débris</i> of the creek towards the
<i>Hermione</i>.
</p>

<p>
The captain, a ruddy-visaged and sandy-haired
man, about thirty-five, with plenty of yellow beard
and moustache, stood up, as he drew near, and
waved his cap.
</p>

<p>
"You have had some sharp work here, I think,"
said he; "we heard the sound of the firing as we
stood round the island.  Glad we have been in
time to save you."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks be to Heaven, you have&mdash;and many
heartfelt thanks to you, for you have indeed saved
all our lives, and my ship, also!" exclaimed
Captain Phillips.
</p>

<p>
"<i>All</i>?  There don't seem to be very many of
you," replied the stranger, as his boat came sheering
alongside, and the oars were all uplifted and laid in
together, while he swung himself up with great
agility, and jumped over the bulwarks on deck,
when the eight of the <i>Hermione</i> gathered round
him.  "Creeping along the shore in search of
fresh water," he resumed, "we were told by an old
Malay boatman&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Puffadder?" said Bartelot.
</p>

<p>
"Yes; you know him then&mdash;that we should find
it here."
</p>

<p>
"The old scoundrel!" exclaimed Heriot.
</p>

<p>
"With the same story he snared us into the
creek," added Phillips.
</p>

<p>
"Old Puffadder wasn't to blame, for he begged
me to make haste and assist a British ship that
some island pirates were attacking, so we clapped
on royals, skysails, gaff-topsail, and everything that
would draw, got our small arms up, our guns cast
loose and all ready to help you, and we seem just to
have been in time."
</p>

<p>
"You have done well and bravely, sir," said
Mr. Basset, with gratitude and enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
"And what ship is yours?" asked Phillips.
</p>

<p>
"The <i>Duke of Rothesay</i>, 800 tons, hailing from
Alloa, and bound for Singapore, Duncan Davidson,
master (that is me) at your service; and yours?"
</p>

<p>
"The <i>Hermione</i>, of London, also bound for Singapore,
and touching at the Isle of France."
</p>

<p>
And now various matters, which are already known
to the reader, were related and explained to the
Scotch skipper, which made him wonder very much;
and much more was his wonder excited when, on
being invited down to the cabin, he found himself
fairly hugged by Rose Basset, who, in fact, was
rather in a delirious state, after all the cannonading
she had heard and the number of savage brown
figures she had seen from the stern-windows
skipping among the mangroves.
</p>

<p>
Ethel threw herself into her father's arms in a
passion of tears, and pressed Morley's hand to her
heart.
</p>

<p>
"Saved, Ethel, saved!" said Mr. Basset, caressing
her tenderly.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Ethel, saved," added Morley, "and except
my scratched ear and Noah's cheek, not a man of
us the worse of the whole affair."
</p>

<p>
"By Heaven's mercy and this gallant seaman's
safe arrival, we have, indeed, escaped a great&mdash;it
would have been, indeed, a <i>last</i>&mdash;peril, Ethel," said
Mr. Basset, as she presented her hand to Captain
Davidson, who, though a rough, weather-beaten,
and rather plain Scotsman, surveyed her soft dark
eyes, her pale and thoughtful face, that beamed
with soul and feeling, her glossy hair and fine
figure, with an admiration that he was too honest
or too unsophisticated to conceal.  So, while he
addressed some words of congratulation and soothing,
to the effect that "all danger was now over, as
he had knocked the black niggers into the middle
of next week," Captain Phillips, acting as his own
steward, has wedged his fat figure into a locker,
from whence he fished out sundry case-bottles and
glasses with nervous rapidity.
</p>

<p>
And this fine stately ship of Alloa, on the Forth,
armed with four twelve-pounders, and having a
crew of forty men and boys, coming with all sails
crowded before a spanking breeze, from near the
cove where old Puffadder's wigwam stood, was what
Morley and Heriot would have seen had they
obtained a south-west view of the ocean, but, as we
have related, an eminence hid her from them, and
the entire islet hid her from the pirates, until, with
shotted guns, loaded rifles, and colours flying, she
came down full swoop upon them.
</p>

<p>
The cutting of the warp and the circumstance of
the <i>Hermione</i> thereby falling away round from the
centre of the creek, greatly favoured the fire of this
friendly stranger's cannon and musketry.
</p>

<p>
So old Radama Puffadder was no traitor, but the
means of saving them, after all!
</p>

<p>
"Those were heavy guns you fired, sir," remarked
Morley to Captain Davidson, who had mixed his
grog, and prior to imbibing it drank every one's
health in the Scotch fashion.
</p>

<p>
"Heavy for a merchantman&mdash;yes; twelve-pounders."
</p>

<p>
"How came you to be so well armed?" asked
Mr. Basset.
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir," replied Captain Davidson, laughing,
as he tossed off his glass of grog, "whether it is the
alleged national caution, or, what is better, the good
old national spirit of pugnacity, I don't know,
but our Scottish ships, especially in these seas, are
generally well armed, and seldom unprepared for
anything&mdash;and I have a splendid crew&mdash;the pick of
Leith and Grangemouth!  So now, Captain Phillips,
my gig is alongside, and while our carpenters come
aboard of you, and put you into a little shape, I hope
the young ladies and your other friends will come
and dine with me, and see what we can find in the
lockers of the <i>Duke</i>?  Don't be afraid, ladies&mdash;I
shall give you something better than sheep's-head
and haggis."
</p>

<p>
This invitation was as promptly accepted as it was
hospitably given, and all prepared to accompany
Captain Davidson, save Mr. Foster and Noah, who
were obliged to remain on board; and fortunately,
Heriot could now prove that the arrow which pierced
the cheeks of the latter was not poisoned.
</p>

<p>
In and around the ships, there was much to make
Ethel and her sister shudder.
</p>

<p>
On the deck, near the taffrail, lay a dead
Madecasse, whose head Morrison had cloven with a
hatchet.  He had the smooth European hair, the
Indian complexion, the broad forehead, the thin
lips (now pale and ghastly) of his mixed and peculiar
race.  His right hand held a broken assegai, and
his left yet clutched the peak halyards, which he had
grasped on gaining the deck.
</p>

<p>
Many bodies floated about in the creek, many
more had sunk, and several places bore unmistakable
tinges of blood among the ooze and green slime,
while four crocodiles were seen at one time devouring
the dead, till fired on by the Scotch sailors.
</p>

<p>
But all these horrors, and their recent alarm, were
gradually forgotten, amid the hospitality and jollity
of Captain Davidson, his mates, and the numerous
crew of the new ship; and as soon as their water-tank
was filled next day, all bore a hand in getting
the <i>Hermione</i> ready for sea, shipping jury spars on
her fore and mizzen topmasts, and warping her out
of the creek.
</p>

<p>
As the <i>Hermione</i> was so short of hands, Captain
Davidson offered to put three men and one of his
apprentices on board, to assist in working her; an
offer which Captain Phillips gladly accepted, and
they agreed to sail together in company.
</p>

<p>
On the second day after the conflict with the
proas, both ships were ready for sea.
</p>

<p>
Morning was dawning on the cliffs of that lonely
isle, and in great beauty.  A long streak of
opal-tinted light spread over the horizon; gradually it
brightened into amber, and from amber melted into
crimson&mdash;the deep crimson of sunset, elsewhere as
the tall Alloa ship weighed anchor, set her canvas,
and began to stand off towards the north-east.
</p>

<p>
A number of her men were still on board the
<i>Hermione</i>, assisting to warp her out.  Her courses
hung in the clew-lines ready to be let fall; her
three jury-topsails were cast loose, and ready for
hoisting, and soon she was ready for sea.
</p>

<p>
Then Ethel and Rose, as they nestled together on
their pillows in the cabin below, heard the cheerful
notes of a fiddle, the tramp of feet as the capstan
bars were shipped, and the Scotch sailors trod
merrily round, to the air of "The Boatie Bows,"
while one sung a song well known on the banks
of the Forth; and louder stamped their feet, and
louder swelled their hearty voices at the chorus of
each verse, of which there were several, like this:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "I have seen the waves as blue as air,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen them green as grass;<br />
  But I never feared their heaving yet,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frae Grangemouth to the Bass;<br />
  I have seen the sea as black as pitch,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have seen it white as snow;<br />
  But I never feared its foaming yet,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though winds blew high or low."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Now, boys," shouted Morrison; "chorus&mdash;chorus!
Heave and rally!  Walk away with it!
Hurrah!"
</p>

<p>
Then heavier trod the feet, and louder swelled
the fiddle, and all their voices rose together:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "When squalls capsize our wooden walls,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the French ride at the Nore,<br />
  When Leith meets Aberdeen halfway,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We'll go to sea no more.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No more,<br />
  We'll go to sea no more."*<br />
</p>

<p class="footnote">
* Book of Scottish Song.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The cheerful voice of Captain Phillips was soon
heard, ordering:
</p>

<p>
"Let fall, and sheet home."
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, Ethel," said Morley, tapping on
her cabin-door; "we are fairly clear of the creek
and its crocodiles, and under weigh for the Isle of
France."
</p>

<p>
It was, indeed, a glorious morning.  Under a
cloud of canvas, even to her royals and angular
sky-sails, the Scottish ship took the lead, and her
giant shadow fell far across the ocean.
</p>

<p>
Red, round, and flashing in his effulgence, up
came the god of day, and the tall reedy cane-brakes
and solemn drooping palm groves of the shore they
were leaving, the sea ahead and the deck beneath
their feet, were all red as if aflame.  Ruddy gold,
edged and gilt every rope, face, and object, the
shadows of the two ships falling in purple on the
crimson flush, which gradually melted away, as the
sun rose upward, and lit all the far horizon of the
Indian Sea.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><br />
THE ANCHOR IS LET GO.
</h3>

<p>
Our story is now drawing to a close, but no sudden
or striking tableau, no tremendous <i>dénouement</i> or
poetical rhapsody will attend the fall of the curtain,
albeit that truth is stranger than fiction.
</p>

<p>
The ships sailed in company.  They were seldom
far apart, and often were so near that those on
board could hail each other and converse.
</p>

<p>
The weather was fine, the trade-wind steady, and
the remainder of the voyage proved alike pleasant
and prosperous.
</p>

<p>
Of the Isle of Bourbon they saw only the smoke
of its volcano, rising into the clear air of a calm
morning, and by sunset of the following day, the
colours displayed from the gaff-peak of the <i>Duke of
Rothesay</i>, which was ten miles ahead, and the
discharge of one of her twelve-pounders to windward,
announced that the Isle of France was in sight
although not visible from the main-top of the
<i>Hermione</i>; but the report of the gun sent a thrill
through the hearts of all on board.
</p>

<p>
The stormy petrel was tripping around them the
same as ever; but they had no fears now, for after
sunset the harbour lights of Port Louis were seen to
twinkle over the sea; so the cables were roused out
of the tier, and rattled cheerily as they were laid
in fakes along the deck; they were bent to the
anchors; the deep sea lead was in constant requisition,
and the hawsers were brought up from between
decks.
</p>

<p>
By daybreak next morning the ships were close
in shore, and in the pilot's charge, with a fine
breeze, ran in between Fort Blanc and the Isles
des Tonneliers, so the spires of the town were right
ahead.  As the ship, with her courses clewed up, ran
under her jury topsails and driver into the fine old
harbour of Port Louis, Morley and Ethel were on
deck together.  Rose was below with Nance
Folgate, busy packing, though her more thoughtful
sister had done all her own share of that duty long
ago.
</p>

<p>
Morley seemed a prey to unusual sadness, and as
she caressed his hand kindly from time to time, and
while her gentle eyes filled alternately with pensive
tenderness or sparkling animation, she could barely
obtain a response to her inquiries; for now that the
voyage was ended, that their dangers were over,
and all excitement had passed away, he felt a
melancholy that he could not overcome, and against
which he struggled in vain.  This emotion was very
natural.  He knew not what was before him now
in this strange land&mdash;this half-French colony, where
on the morrow he would find himself without a
shilling in his pocket.
</p>

<p>
Hesitatingly, and while his now weather-beaten
cheek glowed with honest shame, he said something
of this to Ethel; but she sought to cheer him, and
added that his friends, Captain Bartelot, the Scotch
mate Morrison, and old Noah were precisely in the
same predicament, yet they were all merry as
crickets, whistling and singing, while, with the
three men of the Scotch ship, they hoisted the
great rusty anchors over the bows.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Ethel, do not smile as if you would mock
me," said Morley, with unwonted irritation; "it is
our, or rather my, uncertain fortune that haunts and
galls me now."
</p>

<p>
He knew, beyond a doubt, that the doctor would
marry Rose as soon as he could rejoin her, or get
quit of the ship; Morley knew that Heriot had his
profession, a moderate competence, and excellent
monetary prospects; but what had he?
</p>

<p>
Mr. Basset's health was so hopelessly impaired by
all he had undergone as to preclude any chance of
his assuming his legal functions, or, indeed, doing
more in the matter of his judgeship than simply to
resign it on landing.
</p>

<p>
His local influence would thus be dissipated, and
already he spoke of returning to England on the
first suitable opportunity, resolving to pass the
remainder of his days there, even with his crippled
means; so, after all they had endured, Morley and
Ethel, as they gazed mournfully and tenderly into
each other's eyes, felt that the course of true love
was as unlike a railway as possible.
</p>

<p>
But now the sails were handed, the anchor let go
with a plunge into the seething flood, and exactly
three months and fourteen days from the time of
her leaving the London Docks, the <i>Hermione</i> swung
at her moorings in the harbour of Port Louis,
distant only a few fathoms from her late companion
and protector, the stately ship of Alloa.
</p>

<p>
Quarantine laws, custom-house harpies, and all
such necessary annoyances satisfied, the ship brokers
came on board, and one of them brought for Mr. Basset
a packet of letters, which had arrived fully
a fortnight before, by a passing ship.
</p>

<p>
There were letters for Ethel and Rose, from Jack
and Lucy Page, and other dear friends at Acton-Rennel,
full of home gossip, all of vast interest to
them now; and there were some very business-like
documents "for papa," who carefully wiped his gold
spectacles prior to reading them; while Morley, who
had not a friend in England, felt bitterly there was
nothing for him; so he slunk, as he thought,
unnoticed on deck, to watch the bustle of the port and
shipping, and to forget even himself, if he could,
for a time.
</p>

<p>
The contents of his two first letters certainly
made Mr. Basset stare very much, and wipe his
glasses again, ere he read them a second time, and
fairly took in the full meaning of their contents.
</p>

<p>
They were from his old friend, the M.P. for
Acton-Rennel, who had procured him the now useless
judgeship, and from his solicitor in Westminster,
informing him that, by two most unexpected deaths,
Ethel and Rose, in right of their deceased mother,
had become rich&mdash;quite heiresses in fact, of not less
than three thousand pounds each, yearly, in government
securities and other investments; full particulars
of which would be forwarded by the next mail.
</p>

<p>
Ethel sat for a time like one bewitched, on hearing
this.
</p>

<p>
Then, after Mr. Basset had explained it all to her,
she hurried on deck to where Morley Ashton, with
his head between his hands, was gazing moodily
and dreamily over the gunwale, at the slime and
ooze under the ship's counter; and caring little
whether she were seen or not, she stole one arm
tenderly round his neck, and whispered in his ear
the story of their good fortune, adding that now
she could reward him for all his love and faith, and
for all he had endured: and more than once she had
to repeat all this, ere she was fully understood by the
poor bewildered fellow.
</p>

<p>
Thus, from a state of uncertainty, doubt, utter
despondency at times, was Morley Ashton rewarded,
indeed, for all he had undergone.  The wheel of
fortune had revolved completely in his favour, and
he felt raised "to the seventh heaven" by Ethel's
happy news.
</p>

<p>
So they were now safe, rich, and happy, with
their dearest wishes about to be realised!
</p>

<p>
All around them seemed to be joyous and sunshiny.
All so quiet, so still, and yet such happiness
was theirs!
</p>

<p>
Their double separation, the sorrow of Morley's
supposed death, his detention at Rio, and his
sufferings on the wreck; the mutiny, and the
piratical Malays; the entire past, with all its terrible
contingencies&mdash;where was it now?
</p>

<p>
Gone indeed, and to be forgotten!
</p>

<p>
The future&mdash;oh, they had no fears for it; the
present, the glorious, blissful present, was alone to
be considered.  And so thought Ethel Basset, as on
the last evening they were to spend in the cabin of
the <i>Hermione</i> she sat hand in hand with Morley,
and alone, her head reclined upon his shoulder, and
his arm caressingly around her, as they whispered
of the arrangements they were to make at home,
and how they would have Laurel Lodge again, with
papa to care for, and how Rose and Leslie Heriot
would have one of those pretty new villas with the
green blinds and plate-glass windows at Cherrywood
Hill.
</p>

<p>
Inquiries concerning, or, as the Scots say, "anent"
the loss of the <i>Princess</i>, and the marooning of the
crew of the <i>Hermione</i> in the Mozambique Channel,
were duly conducted by Captain Sir Horace Seymour,
of H.M.S. <i>Clyde</i>, and the nautical assessor of the
Board of Trade at Port Louis, and the decision of
the court freed our friends Bartelot and Phillips
from all blame, their captains' certificates being
returned to them by Sir Horace Seymour, with
many complimentary remarks.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Basset resigned his appointment into the
hands of the Governor, and prepared to return to
England; but as there is no true happiness without
alloy, Heriot could not procure a substitute or
successor, and so, when the <i>Hermione</i> was refitted and
fully manned, he found himself compelled to sail
with her to Singapore.
</p>

<p>
Morrison went with her as chief mate, and Mr. Foster
as second, and she sailed out of Port Louis,
dipping adieux with her ensign, and firing her
carronades in gallant style, old Captain Phillips and
poor Heriot continuing to wave their hats so long as
two figures in light dresses were visible on the mole.
</p>

<p>
Poor little Rose shed abundance of tears.  She
thought herself Virginia torn from her Paul, and
the most ill-used young lady in the world.  She
moped for a long time, and gave up her diary; it
was no use now, when she was so soon to see Lucy
Page again.
</p>

<p>
We need not detail how, prior to their departure,
many a picnic was made to all the places consecrated
by the loves of Paul and Virginia, and how many a
sketch was made in Ethel's portfolio of the Shaddock
Grove, the marvellous Petterbotte, and other
places.
</p>

<p>
Tom Bartelot was to return to England with
them, and get another ship.
</p>

<p>
Noah had been offered a berth on board the
<i>Hermione</i>, but he declined.
</p>

<p>
"No more marchantmen for me," said he; "I'm
for the Queen's sarvice, so long as I can lift tack or
sheet, hand or foot; then Grinnidge arter."
</p>

<p>
So he shipped on board the <i>Clyde</i>, which about
this time steamed away towards the mouth of the
Mozambique Channel, in search of the pirates, who
had again made their appearance in several proas.
</p>

<p>
Noah acted as a species of guide; but no trace of
their presence could be found in that quarter, save
the bare, bleached skull of poor old Captain
Puffadder, whose agency in our friends' escape had
been discovered by the Malays, and who had been
buried by them up to his neck in sand on the
seashore, and left thus to perish under the advancing
tide, like the famous Wigton martyrs of the delirious
sheriff of Dumfries.
</p>

<p>
Notices will be found in the various newspapers
of that month, stating that, in north latitude 27
deg. 30 min., and east longitude 40 deg. 10 min., near
the Europa Rocks, H.M.S. <i>Clyde</i> picked up a boat,
with two dead bodies in it.  One was evidently that
of a South American, with rings in his ears; the
other was of great stature, and supposed to be a
Yankee seaman.
</p>

<p>
Noah declared them to be Zuares Barradas and
Badger, from Cape Cod&mdash;the last of the mutineers.
By a curious coincidence, one of these papers
paragraphed that the Portuguese at Tristan d'Acunha
were building a chapel over the grave of the elder
Barradas, who among them has the reputation of
such great sanctity, that his island is now the scene
of annual summer pilgrimages.

CHAPTER XXV.
<br /><br />
CONCLUSION.
</h3>

<p>
Eight months after all this, it was in the drawing-room
of Laurel Lodge that those whose adventures
we have traced so far were all waiting for the boom
of the dinner-gong, for it was the evening of Ethel's
birthday; and she had been a bride four months,
while Rose had been wedded but a few weeks&mdash;so
both were all smiles, white lace, and loveliness.
</p>

<p>
All that day the familiar chimes of Acton-Rennel
(which had rung in honour of their return) had
jangled merrily in the square Norman tower, sending
their notes over the chase, the mere, the long
green English lanes, and kindling joy in many a
worthy heart that loved the Bassets, and who now,
in home-brewed brown October, drank deep to their
healths, and welcome home!
</p>

<p>
Many of "Papa's household gods," as Ethel
named them, which had been bought by old friends,
found their way back again to Laurel Lodge.
"Mamma's" picture hung in the usual place&mdash;even
on its old nails; and Rose's azaleas still bloomed in
the conservatory, as on the night when Hawkshaw
laughed at them.
</p>

<p>
Morley and Ethel occupied her old room, and
often, when she drew the curtains, she thought of
that terrible morning when she looked up to Acton
Chine and thought a darkness had fallen on the
outer world.  How difficult to realise all that had
passed since then!
</p>

<p>
There was present the old rector (papa's friend);
he had read the last service for Ethel's mamma, and
who preached the sermon prior to their departure;
and there, too, were Lucy Page and her brother
Jack, who looked not a whit the worse for being
jilted by Rose, as all the folks in the village say he
was, for the rector's black-eyed daughter has
undertaken to console him, while Lucy leans with pleasant
confidence on the arm of the young fox-hunting
squire of Cherrywood Hill, in out-door sports the
rival of Jack, who is a first-class shot, and scores
with ease his ninety odd points among the members
of the 1st A.R.R.R.V.C., which mysterious letters
mean the Acton-Rennel Royal Rifle Volunteer
Corps, a distinguished body of men, which our
friend Morley has since joined.
</p>

<p>
The squire of Acton-Rennel had come over in his
old lumbering coach, and sat as of yore in a cosy
easy-chair, opposite Mr. Basset, whose hair has
become rather gray, for he has been much aged by
all he has undergone, though carefully tended by
his daughters, by Morley and Heriot (who, though
quite independent, is rapidly acquiring a splendid
country practice at Acton-Kennel), and by old
Nance Folgate, whose voyaging she believes to
exceed in marvel all that ever was recorded by Sir
John Mandeville or old Richard Hakluyt.
</p>

<p>
Bluff Captain Phillips (who is about to persuade
the plump little widow of Gravesend to change her
name to his) was there too, and his presence made
them regret the absence of honest Morrison, who
had gone home to Scotland, and of jovial Tom
Bartelot, who was in London, it was whispered, with
certain matrimonial views upon the girl of the
Hampton Court memories, in which he indulged
when on the wreck, and which views, we hope, he
may realise ere long.
</p>

<p>
Noah Gawthrop, who was then, as he would have
phrased it, "a brilin' aboard the <i>Clyde</i>," in the
Indian Seas, was not forgotten when the cloth was
removed after dinner; and we believe he will yet
cast anchor in charge of the gate lodge, with its
heraldic unicorns, and may yet teach a little Morley
Ashton to handle an oar in the skiff on Acton mere,
and may become in the bar of the "Basset Arms"
a great oracle upon all that appertaineth unto salt
water.
</p>

<p>
On this evening they were all very happy and
merry, and the jolly rector, in proposing Ethel's
health and prosperity, declared that Mr. Basset's
daughters were alike improved in quality and tint,
for having been&mdash;like good Madeira&mdash;twice round
the Cape, a species of compliment which the two
squires laughed at uproariously, so the hearty
good-humour and merriment waxed apace.
</p>

<p>
"How unlike the past!" thought Morley, as he
glanced at his beautiful young wife in diamonds and
lace; "here, indeed, 'the world seems a good one to
live in, and easy to get on with!'"
</p>

<p>
Morley felt half as in a dream.
</p>

<p>
It was the last day of October, the sun's
declining rays were gilding the shamble-oak, and his
brethren of the old Saxon chase, the tower of the
village church, and the rocks of the chine.  (You
remember them, reader?  If you don't, we rather
think Mr. Ashton does.)  A sky of clouds that were
white, broken, and dappled, edged with gold, and
floating in amber, was over all.  Fragrance and
verdure, fertility and vegetable life, that they may
bud and bloom in all their strength in spring, were
going to sleep for the winter in the coppice and on
the uplands.
</p>

<p>
The nearly-stripped woodlands loomed darkly out
of the golden evening haze, and the glorious sun, as
he sank, while the village chimes rang out, made
Morley feel somehow happy, charitable, and kind
to the world in general.  And so he thought, as he
glanced from Ethel, who was now singing at the
piano one of her old familiar songs to Rose, who,
though a wedded wife, was seated on a hassock near
her father's knee, which had always been her place
after dinner, since she cut her first pearly teeth and
drank milk out of the sponsorial silver mug, given
her by old Mr. Page, Jack's father.
</p>

<p>
She was rollicking, as of old, with Lucy, a
charming specimen of a frank-hearted, fresh-complexioned
country girl, and teasing her brother Jack,
a young Englishman complete, ruddy-cheeked, with
a smart moustache, long whiskers, and a head of
close curly brown hair.
</p>

<p>
Though the prime bowler of the Acton eleven,
the crack shot of the Acton Corps, a fellow who
could run, leap, or shoot even with a Highlandman,
the good wine he had drunk loosed his tongue, and,
as Morley and he promenaded in the avenue, he told
him rather mysteriously, between the puffs of
Latakia, which rose from his meerschaum, that he
"had been jilted by Rose chiefly because he was a
thundering bad dancer, and never knew a note of
music in his life."  But Jack, we have said, was
likely to find consolation.
</p>

<p>
Though leaving them all happy in their old
English home, we feel loath alike to part with them
and with the reader, who has accompanied us so
far; but we leave them all, we hope, with health,
wealth, and young life before them.
</p>

<p>
The sun has set, and the Acton bells have ceased,
so part we must, though, perhaps, for a time.
